### Initial Action Items:
1.  **Reduce 'Wants':** Your initial budget shows a shortfall. The first place to adjust is the 'Wants' category. Can you reduce spending on restaurants or shopping by $400?
2.  **Track Your Spending:** For the first three months, just track your spending in the 'Actual' column without judgment. This will give you a clear picture of where your money is really going.
3.  **Adjust as Needed:** This budget is a starting point. You can and should adjust it as you go.
