**High Agency in a Question**

You wake up in a 3rd world jail cell. You’re only allowed to call one person you know to get you out of there. **Who do you call?**


The one big thing everyone in that high agency room has in common: **They are happening to life.** They don’t view the future as a static entity. They view it as something to be shaped by human action.


*"When you're told that something is impossible, is that the end of the conversation, or does that start a second dialogue in your mind? How to get around whoever it is that's just told you that you can't do something"* - Eric Weinstein on high agency.


High agency can be a confusing idea to understand because it’s not just one idea. It’s a combination of three distinct skills rarely found together:

1.  Clear thinking
2.  Bias to action
3.  Disagreeability

If your problem doesn’t defy the laws of physics, it’s not an unsolvable problem — regardless of what other people say.

If it doesn't defy the laws of physics - you can't give fixed odds on whether a human will solve the problem because of human agency.

Don’t put any adult on a pedestal. Kill your gurus. A more useful belief: The 'adults' aren’t going to save you — they don’t even exist.

ormal behaviour costs nothing in the short term but disappears into the memory abyss. Unconventional weird behaviour costs a price in the short term — but the actions live on as story assets in the future.

1.  If you pay the bill for everyone at the table - the short-term reaction is shock and confusion. In the long term, it’s everyone’s favourite memory of you.  
    ‍
2.  If you travel across the world for a friend's birthday, the friend’s initial reaction is: “You don’t have to do that” — but it’s the story they tell at your wedding.  
    ‍
3.  If you’re 100% honest with your feedback on people’s business ideas, the short-term reaction is anger. In the long term, you become one of the few people they trust.


Go to the funerals of the people you care about and the normal rational behaviour is never mentioned. It’s filled with weird and hilarious stories of the individual — the times they broke out of the median distribution of human behaviour and displayed their uniqueness.


Normal is forgotten. Only weird survives.

Low agency is being stuck for years on a problem without realising it could’ve been solved by one hour of searching YouTube.


Low agency is being “too busy” to reach out to your childhood friend, and getting the phone call that they’ve suddenly passed away.


‍**Vague Trap Escape Route:** *Define the problem in simple words --out of your head*


Write your thoughts down. Draw the problem. Use a whiteboard. Create a spreadsheet. Talk out loud to a smart person. Go for a walk or run with a specific question.


**Step 1 - Stop trying to be the guy on the right -** The midwit mistake is to try and be the smart guy on the right. **‍**

**Step 2 - Become the guy on the left -** Find the simple ideas via inversion. Flip the problem around. And take them seriously before adding any complexity.


E.g. "I want to become a better writer”

The midwit will start learning about writers' coffee-drinking routines or researching the perfect keyboard to enhance their word count. Instead, how would you ensure you become a worse writer?

1.  Do not write
2.  Write inconsistently
3.  Write about things you find boring

Flip them around and you've found the simple ideas the guy on the left will come up with:

1.  Write
2.  Write consistently
3.  Write about things that excite you


This is where your mind has assumptions about reality, treats these assumptions as unquestionable facts — and then starts looking for evidence to support it without once questioning the assumptions.


*Stress primarily comes from not taking action over something that you can have some control over”* - Jeff Bezos


Remember: The adults don't exist. Nobody is going to do agency for you.


If stuck between two potential options, ask: *What is the best story?*


Having a fascinating life story is not just an exercise in vanity -- it has a real impact on your success in life. You'll have an easier time attracting friends as well as life and business partners. It'll also make it much easier to sell yourself or your products. It has a kind of compounding halo effect


So next time you're faced with a tough decision, consider the path that makes a more interesting story. If it turned out to be the wrong decision to have made, you'd at least be fun at dinner parties.
