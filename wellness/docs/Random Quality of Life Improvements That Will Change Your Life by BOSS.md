Walk more. Your health will improve. Your creativity will improve. Your quality of life will improve as a result of those. Everything you can do by walking instead of taking the car. Do it by walking. We suggest that everyone start paying attention to how many steps they take each day. Once you have a good overview of where you are and how it works. Start aiming for 10k steps a day until you don’t feel it is a problem to reach that.


**Get used to the silence (forget about podcasts, music…)**

We are big believers that the noise around you and the constant distraction of music, podcasts, or YouTube in the background destroy your attention span. Not only does it destroy it. It robs you of the present moment and the joy you can experience while doing what you are doing.


Pocket notebook + pen = everything you need to turn your dreams into reality. The ultimate productivity tool. No reason to repeat ourselves. It has helped us and others around us to a point where we feel it is getting mentioned every other time. Everything you write down on paper will become your reality. Sooner or later.


**Notifications OFF at all times**

One of those things that will have a massive improvement on the quality of life. The results of having notifications off? Better focus. Less distractions and even in some cases (less anxiety). Notifications should ONLY be on for family members and emergencies. This applies to all your devices.


How To Prioritize - Qualify Of Life Edition  

  
2.  Health
  
4.  Time
  
6.  Money


The #1 focus should always be health. Without health, you don’t have anything else. Neither time or you have the opportunity to make money. What about time? Similar concept. Money? Again, builds on the other two.


**1. Never tell anyone how much money you make:** Yes, we are serious. Yes, this goes under the quality of life topic. There is no reason you should tell anyone how well you are doing. Just tell everyone that you are part of the herd and making an average income. Forget about being 100% transparent or letting others know what you are up to. It is a net negative game that only brings enemies. What happens if you give them the real number? They will hate you.


**Want to take it a step further?**

- **Level 1:** Regular wake-up/sleep-in time (even on weekends)

- **Level 2:** No eating before sleeping (at least 3 - 4 hours), no exercises before sleeping, magnesium, blackout curtains (or sleeping mask)

- **Level 3:** Sunlight exposure, colder environment, an eight-inch sleep mattress or similar.


Reading GOOD books is the key to accessing the ancient knowledge we lost over time. It will also help you with focus and make you better at connecting general ideas and principles. Forming big pictures and communicating them. You should have at least one or two books to read at all times.


**11. The key to living a productive life is always to minimize:** You want to have as few things as possible to give yourself enough space. Meaning you will not have to come up with the excuse for why you are not doing what you should be doing.


**12. Replace podcasts, audiobooks, and music with phone calls:** Next time you are driving or walking somewhere where you need to be. Instead of listening to something and stimulating your mind. The time you have would be better spent by calling and talking to the people you care about. It is the #1 way to show people you appreciate them and to keep them in your life.


**13. Change your workspace:** One basic creativity hack that plays a big role for those doing 100% creative work is to change your workspace every day. What do we mean by that? Take your laptop and go out. Get out of your house and go to the closest hotel lobby, coffee place, or McDonald’s. Somewhere where you will be able to sit down and work. Want to take it to the next level? Go somewhere that inspires you to be there in the first place. This sounds ridiculous until you start using it and notice the difference between working in your office all the time vs. going somewhere else.
