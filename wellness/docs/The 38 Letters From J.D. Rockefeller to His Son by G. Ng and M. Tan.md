# The 38 Letters From J.D. Rockefeller to His Son by G. Ng and M. Tan

Starting points do not determine your end point Our destiny is determined by our actions, not by our origins.


The only truth is that as long as you work hard enough, you will succeed. I firmly believe that our destiny is determined by our actions, not by our origins.


The glory and success of the family cannot guarantee the future of its children and grandchildren. I admit that the early advantage is really helpful, but it does not guarantee them a victory in the end. I have thought about this distressing problem for rich children more than once. I feel that once rich children begin taking advantage of their family success, they will have little opportunity to learn and develop the skills needed for survival. People of poorer backgrounds will actively develop their creativity, abilities, while also cherishing and seizing various opportunities because they urgently need to rescue themselves. I have also observed that the kind of ambition of the rich children have, often lacks the motivation and attributes the poor, hence they resort to praying for their own success.


Therefore, when you and your sisters were very young, I deliberately concealed the fact that I was well off. I instilled many values ​​such as frugality and personal struggle in you because I know that the quickest way to harm someone is to give them money. It can make people corrupt, depraved, arrogant, and cause them to lose their source of happiness. I cannot bury my beloved children with wealth, and foolishly make you all into one that is incompetent and only depends on the success of their parents.

I do not live by God-given luck, but I do-so by planning luck. I believe that a good plan will affect luck, and in any case, it can successfully affect luck. My plan to turn competition into cooperation in the oil industry justified this.


Visionary businessmen are always good at finding opportunities in every disaster,


The first condition is to know your goals, such as what you want to do, or even what kind of person you want to become; the second condition is knowing what resources you have, such as status, money, interpersonal relationships, and even abilities.


The greatest reward for our hard work is not what we get, but what we will become.


If you view work as a pleasure, life is heaven; if you view work as a duty, life is hell.


Income is just a by-product of your work. Doing what you should do, accomplishing what you should do well, the ideal salary will come. And more importantly, the highest reward for our hard work is not what we get, but what we will become.


Successfully putting a good idea into practice is more valuable than thinking about a thousand good ideas at home. (To conquer you have need to do, to do again, ever to do! And your safety is insured.)


Many people admit that knowledge without experience is useless, but what is even more frustrating is that even if there is knowledge and wisdom but no action, everything is still empty talk.


Too much preparation but no action at all will only waste time eventually. In other words, everything must be done with limits. We cannot fall into the trap of continuous deliberation and planning but we must recognize the reality: no matter how detailed the plan is, we still cannot accurately predict the final outcome.


Action solves everything. Without action, nothing will happen. We cannot buy fool proof insurance, but what we can do is make up our minds to fulfil our plan.


People who lack action have a bad habit: they like to maintain the status quo and refuse to change. I think this is a bad habit that is deceptive and self-destructive because everything is changing, just as people will live and die, there is nothing constant. But because of one’s inner fear – the fear of the unknown, many people resist change.


Only by relying on oneself can a person then not let himself down and increase his chance to control his destiny. Smart people will only make things happen.


To eat an elephant, you need to eat one bite at a time. Same goes to when you are doing something. If you want to accomplish everything at one go, you will only let the opportunity slip away.


Many people make themselves into a passive person. They want to wait until all conditions are perfect, that is, when the time is right, before taking action. Life is an opportunity at any time, but there is almost nothing perfect.


There is never a shortage of people with ideas in our world, but there are very few people who know how to successfully implement a good idea, which is more valuable than thinking about a thousand of good ideas at home.


The real basis people use to judge your ability is not how much you have in your head, but your actions.


To have the habit of doing now, the most important thing is to have a proactive spirit, get rid of the habit of being distracted, be determined to be a person of initiatives, be courageous in doing things, don’t wait until everything is ready, there will never be absolute perfection.


Cultivating the habit of action does not require special wisdom or special skills. You only need to work hard to let good habits bloom in life.


Son, life is a great battle. To win, you need to act, act again, and act forever! In this way, your safety can be guaranteed.


Crutches cannot replace strong and powerful feet; we have to stand on our own feet.


Failure is a good thing as long as it does not become a habit.


If you stay still, you will regress, but to move forward you must be willing to make decisions and take risks.

Everyone hates failure. However, once avoiding failure becomes your motivation for doing things, you embark on a path of laziness and powerlessness.


People always have to maintain their energy, remain strong and persistent, no matter what failures and setbacks they encounter, this is the only thing I can do.


Optimistic people will see opportunity in suffering, and pessimistic people will see suffering in opportunity. Son, remember the formula of success that I believe in: Dream + Failure + Challenge = Success


There is nothing in the world that can replace perseverance.


Lincoln’s life wrote a great truth: unless you give up, you will not be defeated.


Success is a series of struggles.


Everyone’s first step towards success, and also the basic step that cannot be missed, is to believe in yourself and believe that you will be able to succeed. Let the key idea “I will succeed” dominate our various thinking processes.


Successful people are just ordinary people who believe in themselves and affirm what they do. Never, never sell yourself cheaply.


I can assert that in this world, apart from God, there is no one who does not pursue profit. From the moment you step into interpersonal relationships, a protracted life game for profit begins. In this game, everyone is your enemy, including yourself. You need to fight against your weaknesses and against all the evils that build happiness on your pain. Therefore, when I saw through all this, I always adhered to a principle: I can deceive the enemy, but I never deceive myself. Fighting back at the enemy who is shooting me will never disturb my conscience.


I only show my feelings when the situation is only beneficial to myself; I can let my opponent teach me, but I will never teach my opponent, no matter how much I know about it; think twice about everything, no matter how others may urge, do not act without making a full consideration; I have my own truth, only responsible for myself; be careful of those who ask me to treat them sincerely, they want to reap benefits from me.


The people who can get ahead in this world are those who know how to find their ideal environment. If they cannot do it, they will create it themselves.

If You want to make a person disabled, just give him a pair of crutches.


The moral of this story is simple, when an animal depends on humans for food, its wit will be taken away, and then it will be in trouble. The same situation applies to human beings. If you want to make a person disabled, just give him a pair of crutches, and wait for a few months to achieve your goal. In other words, if you give someone a free lunch for a certain period, he/she will develop the habit of getting something for nothing. Do not forget, everyone has a need to be “taken care of” in the womb.

Yes, I always encourage you to help others, but as I always tell you, if you give a person a fish, you can only support him for one day, but if you teach him the skill of fishing, it is equivalent to supporting him for life. This old saying about fishing is very meaningful.


Our wealth is a reward for our hard work.

Not every story is meaningful, but this Arab story has brought me precious life lessons: your diamond is not between the distant mountains and the sea, if you are determined to dig, the diamond is in your backyard. The important thing is to sincerely believe in yourself.

Humans function like a bicycle, unless you move up and forward towards the target, you will stagger and fall.


Only by curiosity can you discover opportunities, and by taking risks can you make use of them.


Revenge on others is an attack on yourself.


know that any slight insult can hurt dignity. However, dignity is not given by God, nor is it given by others. It is your own creation. Dignity is a spiritual product that you enjoy yourself. Everyone's dignity belongs to him. If you think you have dignity, you have dignity. So, if someone hurts your feelings and your dignity, you have to stay calm. If you do not cling to your dignity, no one can hurt you.


Be nice to others when you climb up, because you will run into them when you go downhill.


John, the essence of life is struggle and competition. They are exciting. However, when they develop into conflicts, they are often devastating and destructive, and timely cooperation can resolve them.


Success is not measured by a person’s height, weight, education, or family background, but by the size of his thoughts. The size of our thoughts determines the size of our achievements.


Patience is not blind tolerance. You need to calmly consider the situation and know whether your decision will deviate from or harm your goals.

If you act like a winner, you are likely to do more of what a winner should do, thereby changing your “luck”.


I have never seen people who do not appreciate confident and decisive people. Everyone is a supporter of confident and decisive people. We expect such people to be leaders. The reason why we are attracted to them is that they are very attractive. Therefore, brave people are often more successful and it is easier for them to take on roles as leaders, presidents and commanders. Those who are promoted quickly belong to this kind of person.


The best way to find the best idea is to have lots of ideas.


The greatest success is reserved for those who have the attitude that they can do things better.


I hate my subordinates saying “impossible”. “Impossible” is a term for failure. Once a person is dominated by the idea of ​​“it is impossible”, he can produce a series of ideas to prove that he is right.

The best way to find the perfect idea is to have many ideas. I will continue to set higher standards for myself and others, and constantly seek various ways to improve efficiency, get more rewards at a lower cost, and do more things with less energy. Because I know that the greatest success is those who have the attitude that I can do things better.


Purpose is the basis of my leadership, and purpose is everything.


(A human can alter his life by altering his attitude, and if you think you can do it, you’re right.)


Outstanding leaders are good at using two invisible forces: trust and respect. When you honestly stated your purpose, you also deliver this message: “Because I have enough trust in you, I am willing to confess to you.” It will open the door for people to trust you, and what you embrace is not only the ability of your subordinates, but also the priceless loyalty from them – the loyalty that must be gathered to help you. Trusting others and making others trust myself are the important reasons for my achievements in life.

Blaming is the number one enemy in destroying a leadership.


(Action springs not from thought, but from a readiness for responsibility.)


I told him that the power of money is certainly not to be underestimated, but the power of responsibility is even greater. Sometimes actions do not come from ideas, but from taking responsibility. Everyone at Standard Oil Company has a sense of responsibility, and they all know “What is my responsibility? What can I do to make things better?” But I never talk about responsibilities or obligations. I just create a sense of responsibility in the company through my leadership.


truth. I told him that if we want to survive forever, our leadership style means we have to refuse blaming anyone or anything for any reason. The habit of blaming is like a swamp. Once you stumble and fall into it, you will lose your footing and direction, you will become unable to move and then fall into the predicament of hatred and frustration.


Our motto is that support, encouragement, and respect will be wholeheartedly accepted and double praised. Only making excuses without providing solutions is intolerable in Standard Oil.


Receiving your letter is very exciting to me, because you understand my philosophy which always helps me to succeed in my career: do what you like to do, and leave other things to the people who like to do it.


The person who is most able to create value is the one who is completely devoted to his favourite activities.


One person cannot dominate a team. I do not deny the great role of leaders, but on the whole, victory depends on the team. Any honour I get depends on the strength of the team, and not myself alone. Only when everyone works hard can they believe and expect miracles.


John, no matter what you do, the best way to find the perfect idea is to have a lot of ideas. Before making the best decision, I will devote myself to look for creative and effective options, consider a variety of possibilities, and actively try various options, and then focus on the best option.


To become an outstanding leader, we must make ourselves a strategic thinker, not just a designer of means. We also have to avoid confining ourselves to the established plans. Our motto will still to be focused, but also being flexible. We focus on the process of exploration. In every minute of every day, we can create possible directions that help achieve long-term goals.


You have to be a hopeful person. No matter how bad the situation looks or how bad it actually is, please keep your eyes open to find the infinite hope in it – never give up searching, because hope will always exist.


I believe that all leaders have the obligation to provide hope, not only for themselves, but also guide their employees onto a broad road. Think back to the time in your life when you felt the most hopeless. It might be because you felt that you had nowhere to go or believed that you had no other choice. You were trapped, abandoned, and could not find a way out.

Give people the respect they deserve, and they can fully realize their potential.


(Everyone has an invisible sign hanging from his neck saying: Make me feel important!)

Every employer is like a conductor of an orchestra. He dreams of inspiring and mobilizing the strength of all employees to make as many contributions as possible, helping him play the gorgeous music that makes money, and letting him earn much more money. However, for many employers, this is destined to be an unattainable dream, because they are like that stupid commander, forgetting to treat employees well, so that they easily close the door to which employees are willing to put in effort.


Employers are the guardians of employees, and my employees’ problems are also my problems. I have the rights to choose. I can choose to ignore their needs or choose to meet their needs, but I like to choose the latter. I always try to understand what employees need, and then try to meet their needs. I keep asking them two questions: “What do you need?” and “How can I help?” I am always there to care for them. For me, one of the greatest joys of this position is that I can lend employees a hand.


Salaries and bonuses are quite attractive, but for some people, money does not trigger their motivation to serve, but paying attention can achieve this goal. In my opinion, everyone aspires to be considered valuable, valued, and respected by others. There is an invisible sign hanging on everyone's forehead, which says: Value me!


Being a kind, warm and considerate employer can make employees energetic and have high morales. But expressing gratitude to employees from time to time seems to be very useful. No employee will remember the bonus he received five years ago, but many people will always remember the kinds words of the employer and I will not hesitate to express my gratitude. Nothing has more influence than a timely and direct “thank you”.


The greater the wealth, means the greater the responsibility.


This sounds like a joke. But obviously this is a realm—deciding to adopt a positive attitude to deal with this complex, ups and downs of this world. Once this state is reached, even in negative situations, we can make the mind automatically respond positively. In order to achieve this state, we can only enrich and cleanse our hearts.


Anyone can be a great man We must be the salt of the world.

Why do we use this method to teach history? We must teach the students that no matter how low a person’s position is, as long as he performs his duties, the American people should give him as much honour as a king.


How can history be taught like this? Think about it, everyone, if we only have one General Grant, will the war be won? Oh, no. So why build a grave on the Hudson River? That is not because General Grant himself was a great man. The tomb was built there because he was a representative figure, representing two hundred thousand heroic soldiers who lost their lives to the country, and many of them were as great as General Grant. This is the real reason that beautiful tomb stands on the banks of the Hudson River.


I was even holding “that sabre gleaming in the sun”. What?! Among the soldiers sitting in the city hall that day, there were people who had used their lives to protect me, a half-sized officer, and someone that carried me across the deep river. Some people were not there because they died for the country. The speaker also mentioned them, but they were not noticed. Yes, those who really died for the country were not noticed, but this little boy of me, was said to be the hero of the time.


If you forget what I said tonight, please do not forget the following statement: The person who thinks the most, feels the noblest, acts the most righteous, and lives the most fulfilling life.
