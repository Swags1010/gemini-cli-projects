“The only thing that is truly significant about today, or any other day, is who you become in the process. Each of us are building our own house. Sometimes you might think you are building for your school, your family, your company, or your team, but you are always building your own house… I hope you build wisely.”

“John, everyone wants to start the next Ikea, but few are willing to be faithful selling individual matchsticks door to door. Everyone wants to build the next Apple or Facebook, nobody wants to sell matches door to door. Everyone wants to become a samurai warrior, but few are willing to faithfully chop wood, carry water.


The problem with small is that it isn’t sexy, and it’s often repetitively boring.


‘Everyone thinks greatness is sexy, it’s not. It’s dirty, hard work.’


“In the West, you want everything instantly, but here you must learn to fall in love with the process of becoming great. Now go chop wood, and carry water.”

you look at something as a test, then you will focus only on passing the test instead of maximizing your growth through the experience. Over time, the person who is simply focused on maximizing what they can learn and how they can grow will become much greater than the person who sees life as one continual test to prove themselves.”

“Don’t fall for the trap, John. Even tests in school are not tests. Nothing is a test, it’s only an illusion. Everything is an opportunity to learn and grow, because remember, you are building your own house.”

Your value comes from who you are, not from what you do.


Like thirsty people guzzling salt water, achievement only creates a greater desire for accomplishing more, dehydrating us of true satisfaction and fulfillment.


The scorecard society judges us by is tragically flawed, and pursuing it will leave you completely unfulfilled.


You were created perfectly and meticulously for a purpose John, but if you put the wrong fuel into your gas tank, it is very easy to get discouraged and break down as you go through the journey of life.”


‘Anything that happens to me today is in my best interest and it’s an opportunity to learn and grow.’

comparison is the thief of all joy, and the grass isn’t greener on the other side. The grass is greener where you water it. You have grown up in a society where things like social media and twenty-four hour television have established a culture that is hyper-focused on comparison. But if you are constantly comparing, you will have all the joy sucked out of you. You must focus on your journey, yours alone.”


“If it rains, bottle the water and sell it. If crap falls from the sky, package it and sell fertilizer. If it is sunny, plant a garden. Use what you and you alone have been given. You do not know what other people are going through, and everyone has their own unique struggles


Stop trying to live their life, because there are millions of people who would give anything to live your life. Did you know there are a billion people without access to clean drinking water, and millions of people with debilitating diseases and accidents that have left them nearly paralyzed?”


“I guess I got so distracted with the people who seemingly have more than me, that I forgot about those with less than me.”


“You must always keep perspective, John. It is very easy to lose it, and when you lose perspective you forget that this life is but a vapor; we are here today and gone tomorrow. Do not waste your life, John. Focus on what truly matters, and do not fall for the lies of the comparison thief.”

the rough side of the mountain actually molds you and shapes you into a person who can travel much further in life, just like those roughed-up golf balls. The blemishes, scars, and setbacks are what give you the character to take you places other people are too soft and smooth to go!”


Words put pictures in your mind.

Pictures in your mind impact how you feel.

How you feel impacts what you do.

What you habitually do impacts your destiny.


not forgiving people is like swallowing a deadly drug and hoping the person who wronged you dies from it.”


Talk to yourself instead of listening to yourself.


Ask the question, “What is one thing I can do to make the situation better?” rather than, “why is this happening to me?”


Live by principles rather than feelings.

•   Your choice creates your challenge
•   • You are building your own house
•   • Your choice creates a challenge for those on your team
•   • You will reap what you sow
•   • The grass is greener where you water it
•   • The wise man finds the diamonds on his own land


“John, there is only one thing you have to do in life, and that is die. You are always doing what you want to do, because there is always a choice. You may not like the choices, or the consequences, but you always have a choice. When you tell yourself that you have to do something, it creates a negative internal energy, but when you realize you want to do something it creates a more beneficial internal energy.”


Goals actually allow you to shirk responsibility. But a mission? Only the person in the mirror can stop you from living that out.


The ultimate illusion of the human experience is control[6](private://read/01k45zjgh3hwezmaxd4a8t48vw/SKU-001055353_TEXT_split_035.xhtml#footnote-31084-6). The person you want beside you in battle is the guy who has surrendered the outcome, and surrendered to the fact that he might die. When you surrender the outcome, you are freed up to be at your best, to be in the moment, and to trust your training. It is the one who has surrendered the outcome who ironically has the greatest chance of survival.


It is the one who has surrendered the outcome who has the greatest chance of success. It is the one who has surrendered to the fact that he could fail, who has the greatest likelihood of not failing. Until you surrender the outcome, you will always be the greatest enemy to your own success. In order to reach your greatest potential you must operate with a heart posture of gratitude, commit to the controllables, surrender the outcome, and trust the process.

John, this is where I learned the truth about partially controllable goals: they are very alluring, but very dangerous. Things like winning, rebounding, sales, or beating your opponent’s records, can distract us from what is more important: the person we become on the journey.


the principle says you are going to reap what you sow.

The principle says that diligent workers are going to serve kings instead of ordinary men.

The principle says to turn the other cheek.

The principle says to seek wise counsel.

The principle says to speak life and not death.

At the end of principles there is life, freedom, hope, joy, and peace.


“One: you are building your own house. Two: to play present, you must train to live present. Three: you must surrender the outcome and commit to the process or you will become your own worst enemy. And four: no matter what my circumstances are, always chop wood and carry water.”


But we weren’t created to sit still and learn the ‘right’ answer. We were created to explore, create, to be loved, to love and to learn.


“You know now that excellence is within your reach, John. It is accomplished through deliberate actions, ordinary in themselves, performed consistently and carefully, made into habits, compounded together and added up over time.
