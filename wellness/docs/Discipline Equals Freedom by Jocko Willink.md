# Discipline Equals Freedom by Jocko Willink

THERE IS NO EASY WAY. There is only hard work, late nights, early mornings, practice, rehearsal, repetition, study, sweat, blood, toil, frustration, and discipline. DISCIPLINE.

Discipline: The root of all good qualities. The driver of daily execution. The core principle that overcomes laziness and lethargy and excuses. Discipline defeats the infinite excuses that say: Not today, not now, I need a rest, I will do it tomorrow.

Where does discipline come from? This is a simple answer.  Discipline comes from within.  Discipline is an internal force.

The only person you can control is you. So focus on making yourself who you want you to be:   Faster. Stronger. Smarter. More humble. Less ego.   Discipline your body. Free your mind. Get up early, and go. Get after it and you will become the person you want to be. And you become that person through:        One. Small. Decision. At. A. Time.

You have control over your mind. You just have to assert it. You have to decide that you are going to be in control, that you are going to do what YOU want to do. Weakness doesn’t get a vote.         Laziness doesn’t get a vote.               Sadness doesn’t get a vote.                   Frustration doesn’t get a vote.                                        Negativity                   DOESN’T GET A VOTE!

MIND CONTROL. Impose what you want on your brain:   DISCIPLINE. POWER. POSITIVITY. WILL.

Humans can withstand almost inconceivable stress—and you can too.

**Tags:** orange


So that is your first step: Gain perspective. And to do that you must do something critical in many situations: Detach. Whatever problems or stress you are experiencing, detach from them. Stress is generally caused by what you can’t control.

If the stress is something that you can control and you are not, that is a lack of discipline and a lack of ownership.

It takes both emotion and logic to reach your maximum potential, to really give everything you have, to go beyond your limits.

**Tags:** orange


Fight weak emotions with the power of logic; fight the weakness of logic with the power of emotion.

Something I saw in combat that I later tried to train out of people was the tendency to relax once the primary objective of a mission was complete. I tried to train that out of them because you can’t relax until the entire mission is complete.

Discipline starts with waking up early. It really does.

Discipline is about facing your fears so you can conquer them. Discipline means taking the hard road— the uphill road.

**Tags:** orange


Is this what I want to be? This? Is this all I’ve got—is this everything I can give? Is this going to be my life? Do I accept that?

STAND UP. GO FORWARD.   Go out in a blaze of glory, fighting with everything you’ve got, every ounce of energy, every bead of sweat, every drop of blood— until your last breath.   And then—and only then—can you stand down, put down your sword and your shield, and rest: in peace.

So to me, it is not about nature or nurture: It is about choice. The people who are successful decide they are going to be successful. They make that choice.

**Tags:** orange


You are never too old to decide where you are going to focus your efforts and push to make the most out of every situation.

**Tags:** orange


Think about where you are going, and choose. Choose to make yourself smarter and stronger and healthier. Choose to work out and study and eat good food and keep your mind clean. Don’t let nature or nurture make you.                    Choose to MAKE. YOUR. SELF.

I want you to be afraid of failure.   FEAR OF FAILURE IS GOOD. Fear of failure will keep you up at night, planning, rehearsing, going over contingencies. Fear of failure will keep you training hard. Fear of failure will stop you from cutting corners.

How do I handle those days when I’m just not “feeling it”? Those days when I am tired or worn out or just sick of the grind… What do I do on those days?   I GO ANYWAY. I GET IT DONE.   Even if I am just going through the motions— I GO THROUGH THE MOTIONS.

We get one shot at this gig right here: Life. One life—that’s all we’ve got. And the most important thing to understand about regret is that in and of itself, regret is worthless. It does nothing for you. In fact: The only thing valuable in regret is the lesson you learned. The knowledge you gained. But walking around filled with regret gets you nothing. So. Learn and move on.

To win, all you have to do is overcome that moment: The Waiting. The Hesitation. And to do that, all you have to do is: Go.

**Tags:** orange


Move. Take the action. Get out of bed. Get your feet on the ground. Step forward. Do not hesitate.         Do not wait.                      Go forward: And win.

**Tags:** orange


Step up. Be the one who people look to. Absorb the impact—and the negativity. Draw fire—yes: Draw fire.

**Tags:** orange


And that is the ultimate victory: To hold your head high, and—even in the face of inescapable defeat—                   To Stand and Fight.

No. Accept reality, but focus on the solution. Take that issue, take that setback, take that problem, and turn it into something good.

**Tags:** orange


And I realized, there is good; even in death there is good. First of all, I was lucky to have had that person in my life; even if it was only for a short time—too short a time—at least I got that.

This isn’t a part-time gig. This isn’t punch the clock and go home for the day. You don’t get weekends off.   No.   Here: There’s no such thing as a weekend. This is an everyday gig: Every day is a Monday. And you might not like that.

**Tags:** orange


No more excuses. No more: “I’ll start tomorrow.” No more: “Just this once.” No more accepting the shortfalls of my own will. No more taking the easy road. No more bowing down to whatever unhealthy or unproductive thoughts float through my mind.   No.   No more. No more waiting for the perfect moment and no more indecision and no more lies. No more weakness.

**Tags:** orange


I will become what I want to be. I will become who I want to be. And then—and only then—will I rest and say:   No more.

One of the most powerful things you can do as a human being is learn to detach.   Detach from your ego. Detach from your emotions. Detach from your perspective. Detach from yourself.

**Tags:** orange


How do you detach?   First: Recognize that you need to detach. Recognize that your ego is a trap. While it is a force that can drive you to success, if it gets out of control, it can drive you crazy.

**Tags:** orange


You must detach from your emotions.

**Tags:** orange


Once you recognize that you need to detach: Take a step back.

**Tags:** orange


One last note: If you are going to speak but you want to remain detached, instead of making a statement try asking a question in a calm, controlled voice. A statement plants you into the ground and removes your maneuverability; you become attached. A question keeps your mind open and allows you to remain detached.
