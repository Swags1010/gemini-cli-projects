# Ikigai &Amp; Kaizen by Anthony Raymond

You must set and accomplish new goals (of one form or another) each and every day, until the day you die.


Though the size and complexity of your goals will vary throughout your life, the necessity to set new goals will persist. There will never be a day when you find yourself without a goal (of some size) to complete.


Every moment of your life is either a test or a celebration.


we lack the conviction and willpower necessary to see a long-term goal to its completion. Unfortunately, we humans often find it difficult to engage in the self-directed pursuit of a lengthy project, especially when there are no external drivers prodding us to action. Momentous life goals require us to commit to the completion of strenuous activities each day. But inactivity is the default state of man.


When our bodies are comfortable, well-fed, and safe, then our lower mind (aka our “lizard brain,” “reptilian complex,” or “limbic system”) would prefer to remain inactive. Though our conscious mind is well aware of next week’s looming deadline, our lower mind thinks that next week is a million years away. It lives in the here and now. The future is an abstract concept that doesn’t require immediate attention. Hence, it’s easy for our lower mind to ignore it.


Our mind often seems to be pursuing two contrary sets of goals. The activities that we should be doing are often not the activities that the lower mind necessarily enjoys doing.


It’s time to put a stop to these old habits and try something new. It’s time to stop procrastinating. It’s time to learn how to set goals and accomplish them with gusto. It’s time to complete the task you were put on this planet to do.


Ikigai is a Japanese life strategy that emphasizes the importance of finding your “true calling.” Colloquially, the word can be translated as “your reason for living” or your “reason to get out of bed in the morning.”


“Lingchi,” is a Chinese term that is commonly translated in the West as “death by a thousand cuts.”


“Hansei” (honest self-reflection). Hansei is a Japanese method for understanding “what went wrong.” It’s about seeking clarity of thought through careful consideration of past mistakes. A skilled Hansei practitioner can analyze the multidimensional failures that led to an undesirable outcome. And, in doing so, he or she can gain valuable insights that will prevent similar errors from occurring in the future.


“Kaizen,” — often translated as “continuous improvement.” With Kaizen, we understand that the answers to life’s biggest quandaries do not come in the form of a magic pill. Instead, our most momentous accomplishments are typically the result of years of concentrated effort and dedication.


So a casual English translation of the term Ikigai might be “that which brings benefit to life.” But many other interpretations have been suggested, such as: “the thing that gives your life meaning” your “true calling” your “labor of love” or, simply “your passion”


“When you wake each morning, how do you feel about the workday that awaits you?” Do you rise from bed with gusto—eager to take on new projects and meet new challenges? Or, do you close your eyes in sorrow—sickened by the thought of spending yet another day at the office?


In the Okinawan language there is not even a word for retirement. Instead there is one word that imbues your entire life, and that word is “Ikigai.” And, roughly translated, it means “the reason for which you wake up in the morning.” For this 102 year old karate master, his Ikigai was carrying-forth his martial art, for this 100-year-old fisherman, it was continuing to catch fish for his family—three times a week… The Institute on Aging actually gave a questionnaire to…these centenarians, and one of the questions was… “what is your Ikigai?” And they all instantly knew why they woke up in the morning.


Factor 1: Mastery Mastery describes our innate desire to become competent at our chosen skill. If you’ve ever taken the time to observe the work of a craftsman (like a machinist, a woodworker, a programmer, a violinist, or a painter) then you’ve been subject to a display of mastery in action. During such engagements, notice how the mind seems occupied and hyper-focused on the task at hand. Observe how the senses are fully dedicated to completing the objective. Note how the craftsman seems to become one with his instrument.


Factor 2: Purpose Purpose describes our desire to engage in activities that are beneficial or meaningful to ourselves, our family, or our community. When your lower mind perceives a task as resulting in true value or utility, then it will encourage you to complete this task. On the other hand, when the mind doesn’t see any immediate value in performing the task, then it will discourage you from laboring through it. And your limbic system will introduce emotions to your conscious mind—like boredom, doubt, fatigue, and despair—to dissuade you from continuing to expend energy on the objective. You just won’t feel very interested in hauling the workload.


Though the product or service you provide may be modest, this does not mean that your labor is not important. If your work results in some modicum of value to the world (i.e., if you know how to fulfill a need, quench a thirst, alleviate pain, or make people smile) then: You are important. Your product is important. And you provide value to the world.


It is easier to destroy than to create. Most people in this world don’t create anything. If you’re part of a team that creates a product that is of some genuine value to mankind, then your vocation is a righteous one. The more value you provide, the more righteous your cause will be. And the more apt your lower mind will be to summon the forces of intrinsic motivation each workday.


Factor 3: Autonomy Autonomy describes our desire to lead a self-directed life. We all crave the freedom to make hour-by-hour choices regarding our daily activities—shaping the course of our lives in a way that reflects our personal dreams and values. We all seek the ability to arrange our schedules and make independent decisions that empower us to pursue endeavors that resonate with our goals. In discovering a career path that affords us a high degree of personal or intellectual freedom, we will be more inclined to experience the intoxicating elixir of intrinsic motivation at the start of each workday.


procrastinate is to voluntarily delay an intended course of action—despite expecting to be worse off for the delay.


Moreover, it’s simply not the case that our subject is procrastinating because of a “lack of time.” He has time available to him. He’s just not using it to do anything productive. Ironically, it is actually the threat of insufficient time (i.e., a looming deadline) that is most effective in terminating a procrastination session. This is why every student discovers the will to study for their final exam on the night before the test.


Use an hourly calendar to block out distraction-free work times.


Use the Pomodoro Method to concentrate in 25-minute bursts of attention, followed by a 5-minute break.


Mastery describes our inner urge to “be the best.” I.e., to become an expert in a particular skill. Purpose describes our desire to engage in endeavors that yield a great benefit of some sort (financial, spiritual, educational, etc…). Ideally, such endeavors will result in long-lasting and meaningful value to us, our family, our community, our planet, or perhaps to all of the above. Autonomy describes our desire to lead a self-directed life—one that affords us with the freedom to make choices for our daily actions, manifesting personal agency as we plot a personalized course for the journey of our life.


The seven deadly sins represent Evagrius’ attempt to cite the seven most pernicious “afflictions,” which he believed all good men ought continuously struggle to restrain. They are: Lust: unbridled sexual desire. Gluttony: the overindulgence (or overconsumption) of anything (food, sex, power, etc.). Greed: the rapacious pursuit of material possessions. Sloth: a reluctance to work or an apathetic approach to daily activities. Wrath: uncontrolled feelings of anger, rage, and hatred. Envy: resentment about the traits or possessions of others. Pride: excessive hubris or misplaced self-confidence.


What’s paramount is that you recognize that the seven deadly sins are really just a warning against allowing one’s natural faculties to be expressed to excess. When appropriately enacted, each of these behaviors has utility. Lustful sexual desire makes human mating possible. Gluttonous hunger prompts us to seek out sustenance. Greed (or the pursuit of material goods) is essential in that we must own some possessions just to survive. Sloth can prevent us from devoting energy to activities that may not result in a net benefit. Wrath can be justified in times when self-defense is necessary. Envy can incite us to action and drive us to improve our position in life. Pride can be properly displayed in the form of a spirited and self-confident persona. None of these behaviors are evil in and of themselves. It is only when they are taken to the extreme that these actions become “sins.”


Lust: Watching pornography when you should be studying. Gluttony: Spending the evening consuming a pepperoni pizza, buffalo wings, and beer. Greed: Online shopping for things desired but not needed. Sloth: Playing video games. Wrath: Discursive thought about past girlfriends or current class rivals. Envy: Harboring jealousy over a roommate’s new sports car. Pride: Proclamations that one is too smart for schooling or that homework is for stupid people.

Goal Killer #1: Inactivity Mastering the art of personal self-discipline starts with first identifying which behaviors are most harmful to our mental and physical wellbeing. It is very easy to get caught in a negative feedback loop. The farther we stray from our life path, the more we feel fatigued, anxious, and depressed. These emotions may manifest as yet more lethargic behaviors—making us even less productive.


Mankind can create many things, but we can’t create time. The amount of time available for the accomplishment of your goals is forever decreasing. With each tick of the clock, the end of your time draws nearer. This is why you must value your time as you value a diamond ring or a gold watch. It’s a precious resource that can never be replenished.


Inactivity leads to hasty decisions. When faced with an upcoming deadline, it is forever tempting to perceive the amount of time available for the project’s completion as much longer than it actually is. You are most likely well familiar with this illusion.


Inactivity causes us to miss valuable opportunities. Often, the achievement of a grand life goal is dependent upon a serendipitous discovery—of the sort that cannot be unearthed while sitting in front of the television set. This is why consistent daily action is so essential. Because it is only by walking the path that new paths will emerge. If you remain stagnant and cease your forward movement down life’s winding road, then the adventures that lie beyond the next bend will never be revealed to you.


Goal Killer #2: Toxic People Perhaps you are fortunate enough to be surrounded by goodhearted people—dynamic, intelligent, and generous souls who genuinely wish the best for you. Many such people do indeed exist in this world. However, it is perhaps more common to meet people of the other variety: People who are better at criticizing than doing. People who try to pull you down to their level. People who live only for the next weekend adventure. People who live to drink and party. Or, people who have given up on life altogether.


We are the sum of the five people closest to us.


Goal Killer #3: Crippling Fear If you come across a bear while hiking in the woods, your body’s first instinctual reaction will be to cease your forward movement. In such a circumstance, this inactivity may be the correct response, and it might even save your life. But when we allow irrational fears to continually halt our forward progress, then the emotion becomes problematic.


Managing risk and fear is a skill that must be honed throughout your life. As each new opportunity reveals itself, you must be ready to objectively assess its associated risk and manage your personal fears, misgivings, and doubts about the venture.


Just as the force of gravity is an immutable property of the cosmos that we must learn to coexist with, so too must be our relationship with change.


Is any man afraid of change? What can take place without change? What then is more pleasing or more suitable to the universal nature? … Can you take a hot bath unless the wood for the fire undergoes a change? And can you be nourished unless the food undergoes a change? And can anything else that is useful be accomplished without change? Do you not see then that for yourself also to change is just the same, and equally necessary for the universal nature?


In Japanese, the term “Hansei” is comprised of the words: “Han” and “Sei.” “Han” means “to turn over and examine.” And “Sei” means to “look back upon in review of the past.”

Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.


Hansei in other cultures The idea that one should devote time to meditative and honest self-critique is probably not new to you. The ancient Greeks espoused the value of reflective contemplation with the phrase “temet nosce” or “know thyself.” Socrates expounded upon this concept when he offered that “The unexamined life is not worth living.” The Germans have a proverb which advises “Selbsterkenntnis ist der erste Schritt zur Besserung,” or “Self-awareness is the first step to improvement.” And, an oft-cited Alcoholics Anonymous doctrine reads “The first step is admitting you have a problem.”


In one sentence, we might define Hansei as: The practice of carefully identifying, considering, and taking responsibility for past mistakes or shortcomings, followed by the implementation of changes to ensure that these errors do not reoccur.


Your first steps with Hansei Step 1. Find a time and a place for quiet contemplation We begin the Hansei ritual by devoting a block of time to a “Hansei-kai” or “reflection meeting.” In the Japanese corporate world, this is a meeting of the minds in which employees engage in humble self-reflection about how a particular situation could have gone better. At Toyota, some departments insist that employees dedicate weekly hours to such sessions—especially following the completion of a key project milestone.


Step 2. Review a past failure or mistake Once you have managed to find a moment for a Hansei-kai, then it’s time to engage in introspection. Start by setting a timer for ten minutes and then select a recent incident in which you failed to accomplish one of your goals. Try asking yourself the following questions: What was my original intent in pursuing this goal? What actions did I take to make this goal a reality? What outcome was I expecting from this effort? What was the actual outcome? Why is the expected outcome different than the actual outcome?


Step 3. Log your negative tendencies After performing the Hansei ritual for a few days, one of the first things you’ll notice is how often you make the same set of mistakes—again and again. You’ll catch yourself wondering: Why did I send that text message when I knew I should be working? Why did I neglect to verify that missing order invoice when I knew the clerk had trouble hearing me? Why did I walk into that pastry shop when I knew I couldn’t walk out without buying something?


4. Make a commitment to be better There is a difference between knowing the path and walking the path. Merely recognizing your mistakes is only the first step. Correcting them is the next challenge.


Are you tempted to glance at your phone during a study session? Make a rule to leave it at home when you go to the library to study. Are you tempted to start a fight with your brother-in-law whenever he starts talking about politics? Make a rule to change the subject. Are you tempted to buy a hotdog when you pass the vendor at your building’s front entrance? Make a rule to enter via the side entrance.


The longer your Hansei log grows, the more you’ll understand how difficult it is to break a bad habit, and the more you’ll catch yourself falling into the same trap, again and again. But, as Alexander Pope wrote, “To err is human; to forgive, divine.” In Hansei, we take a rare moment to acknowledge that we are vastly flawed creatures—riddled with contradictions and burdened with whims—most of which we are only sparsely aware of. Pledging to remain cognizant of our shortcomings and to improve upon our future circumstances is the goal of a Hansei practice.


Hansei is really much deeper than reflection. It is really being honest about your own weaknesses. If you are talking about only your strengths, you are bragging. If you are recognizing your weaknesses with sincerity, it is [a sign of] strength. But it does not end there. [You must also commit to change, and strive to] overcome those weaknesses…


Principle 1. Avoid self-justification—even if you’re convinced that the problem is not your fault. Complex problems are rarely the fault of just one person. Instead, a catastrophe usually comes at the end of a long chain of errors committed by multiple people over a lengthy timespan. It is always tempting to assign the majority of the blame to another party. And, it indeed may be the case that this other party is wholly responsible. But, in Hansei, we don’t play the “blame game.” Instead, a Hansei-kai is a temporary safe space in which you look inside yourself in an attempt to account for the role that you have played in the formulation of the problem.


Such avoidance strategies are not welcomed during Hansei. Instead, we are to focus on: Acknowledging mistakes and accepting responsibility for failure. Finding ways to identify and halt the repetition of bad habits. The implementation of changes needed to ensure that our future goals can benefit from past lessons learned.


Principle 4. Remain humble in success and failure Charles Darwin once wrote: Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge. Recent research seems to have confirmed his suspicions. The Dunning-Kruger effect (as coined by social psychologists David Dunning and Justin Kruger) is an oft-cited cognitive bias in which people with a low skill level in a given task tend to overestimate their abilities.


Unconscious incompetence: When our subject starts his first day on the job, he is wholly unaware of the degree to which his skill level is lacking. Conscious incompetence: After a few days of work, the subject may begin to realize how much he doesn’t know yet, and how much he still has to learn. Conscious competence: The subject has been training for quite some time now. He can complete the task at hand if he devotes conscious mental effort to it. Unconscious competence: The subject has been with the company for a long time. His work is now “second nature” to him. He can perform the task without even thinking about it.


Even if a task is completed successfully, Toyota recognizes the need for a hansei-kai “reflection meeting”… [It’s] a process that helps to identify failures experienced along the way and create clear plans for future efforts. An inability to identify issues is usually seen as an indication that you did not stretch to meet or exceed expectations, that you were not sufficiently critical or objective in your analysis, or that you lack modesty and humility. Within the process, no problem is itself a problem.


Kaizen is a goal-achievement technique that encourages continuous improvement via daily incremental progress.


Kaizen Principle 1: Start working toward your goal immediately, even if your first action is laughably small. In Kaizen, our first step is to atomize the challenge before us. We do this by asking ourselves one question: What small step could I take today which may (in the long run) improve my situation? This initial query is foundational in Kaizen, and we’ll be referring to it many times throughout this book. Our aim here is twofold: First, we want to break our objective down into its smallest constituent parts—identifying the challenges that will be easiest to tackle first. Second, by surmounting the tiniest hurdles first, we hope to build up psychological momentum. Your lower mind needs to believe that it has the ability to accomplish a smaller goal before it will allow your conscious mind to engage in loftier pursuits.


even a tiny action is better than no action at all. For example: Instead of choosing to work on nothing today, you might try writing just one paragraph of your novel. Instead of staring at the rubbish pile in your garage, you might try spending five minutes cleaning out one section. Instead of refusing to exercise at all today, you might try jogging on your treadmill for one minute.


With Kaizen, we identify the problem, break it down into small achievable goals, and we put one foot in front of the other—progressing steadily forward in pursuit of our prime objective. With Kaizen, we don’t spend too much time worrying about the vastness of the challenge that lies before us. Instead, the next step itself is the only challenge we’re concerned with.


A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.


Merely observing a problem’s cause and effect can be more difficult than it sounds. Consider this passage from Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes short story “A Scandal in Bohemia:” “When I hear you give your reasons,” [Watson] remarked, “the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning, I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.” “Quite so,” [Holmes] answered… “You see, but you do not observe.”


Cataloging your detrimental behaviors (taking note of your own shortcomings) requires a level of honest critique that many are unwilling to engage in, or may not have the capacity to perceive. Just as Watson had to defer to Holmes’s superior observational skills, so too must we be open to critique and criticism from others—especially those who have our best interests in mind.


The planning phase of the OPDCA cycle calls upon us to devise a process to improve our situation. Of course, we can never be sure that the strategy we’re about to execute will produce results that are superior to our current course of action. But that’s ok. Remember, Kaizen was initially developed to allow factory workers to attempt small improvements to a process, given the limited resources of the pre-war economy.


The Scientific Method: Ask a question Form a hypothesis Conduct an experiment Analyze your data Report on your conclusions These steps are comparable to those seen in the “Observe-Plan-Do-Check-Adjust” method described above.


Figure 8 - The OPDCA cycle repeats indefinitely despite the outcome. The mindset that is cultivated via this framing is essential to the success of the process. Recall how Thomas Edison famously recounted his many failed attempts to invent the lightbulb stating: I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.


This is the sort of outlook we must adopt as practitioners of Kaizen. A setback is not a reason to quit. Instead, it’s just a data point to be evaluated during our adjustment phase. Your ability to tolerate life’s many challenges is in large part dependent upon your ability to properly frame them. You must learn to see obstacles as opportunities for learning, rather than as excuses for capitulation.


Additionally, just as we are to interpret failure as a motivator to press on and keep trying, so too must we view success in a similar light. In Kaizen, there is no such thing as “good enough.” We are never permitted to be “set in our ways.” That old line your grandma used to say, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,” is antithetical to this methodology. Instead, with Kaizen, we are vigilant to rectify the little inefficiencies of our lives in whatever form they manifest. While we will never achieve perfection, there is great value to be garnered in our devotion to its continual pursuit.


The UK’s Institute of Quality Assurance defines “continuous improvement” as: …a gradual never-ending change which is…focused on increasing the effectiveness [or the] efficiency of an organization… Put simply, it means “getting better all the time.”


Figure 9 - The goal of the OPDCA cycle is to help us continually progress toward whatever goal we choose.


“My problem is that I’m always late for class.” Why? - Because it took too long to walk across the college campus and arrive at my classroom on time. Why? - Because I missed the morning bus. Why? - Because I wasn’t waiting at the bus stop when it arrived. Why? - Because I didn’t leave my house early enough to make it to the bus stop on time. Why? - Because I stayed in bed too long and didn’t have enough time to get dressed and eat breakfast.


[Seinfeld] said the way to be a better comic was to create better jokes. And the way to create better jokes was to write every day. He told me to get a big wall calendar that has [an entire] year on one page… The next step was to get a big red magic marker. [Then] for each day that I do my task of writing, I get to put a big red X over that day. After a few days, you’ll have a chain. Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day. You’ll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job is to not break the chain. “Don’t break the chain!”


Don’t break the chain on your workouts and you’ll find that you get fit rather quickly. Don’t break the chain in your business and you’ll find that results come much faster. Don’t break the chain in your artistic pursuits and you’ll find that you will produce creative work on a regular basis. So often, we assume that excellence requires a monumental effort and that our lofty goals demand incredible doses of willpower and motivation. But really, all we need is dedication to small, manageable tasks. Mastery follows consistency.


In God we trust, all others must bring data.


In the previous chapter, we discussed how our adventures with Kaizen always start with one question: What small step could I take today which may (in the long run) improve my situation?


Question 1: What is holding you back? Often, the most difficult part of the goal-attainment process does not hinge upon your willingness to change yourself. Instead, the process relies upon your willingness to change your environment. If prompted, you could probably identify several negative influences in your environment which are currently hindering your development. Are your neighbors partying at all hours of the night? Did you spend more time in the corner bar last week than you’d like to admit? Are you stuck in a one-horse town? Are your evenings spent playing video games with your roommate? Does your neighborhood have a crime problem? Does your car window get smashed once a month? Are you too tired to pursue your side projects after your long evening commute?


Accomplishing your life goals often means telling friends and family that you hear an alternate calling in life.


Question 4: How would you define an “ideal workday?” When you wake each morning, you should have a template in mind which describes what an “ideal workday” looks like. In outlining such a day, it’s important to avoid confusing an “ideal workday” with a “successful day” or a “lucky day”—such as a day when your stocks go up in value or when you receive a new promotion. Such events should be celebrated. But an ideal workday is not dependent upon the whims of fortune or serendipity. Instead, we define it this way: An ideal workday is one in which you complete all of the objectives that are under your control.


Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.


What small step could I take today which may (in the long run) improve my situation?


Complacency is the arch-enemy of Kaizen.


Productivity is not about how to get more things done; it’s about how to get the right things done. It doesn’t mean just doing less for the sake of less... [It’s] about making the wisest possible investment of your time and energy in order to operate at [your] highest point of contribution.


What small step could I take today which may (in the long run) improve my situation?


80% of your sales come from 20% of your clients. 80% of your leads come from 20% of your ads. 80% of your revenue is generated by 20% of your products.


…people that are measured by counting are deprived of pride of workmanship. The “number of designs that an engineer turns out in a period of time” would be an example of an index that provides no chance for pride of workmanship. He dare not take time to study and amend the design…to do so would decrease his output.


Deming was a statistician, but he was quick to note that an employee’s worth is not so easily surmised by a single data point. Instead, fostering an environment in which work is completed with pride can be more valuable than any numerical measure of raw output. Landing a job that is capable of stirring such passions can be more important to the employee than any other executive amenity—particularly of the type that appears on a corporate brochure.


…pride of workmanship means more to the production worker than gymnasiums, tennis courts, and recreation areas… [Other than salary,] people require...their careers [to offer] ever-broadening opportunities—to add something to society, materially and otherwise.


The method by which such displays are rendered will vary from industry to industry. The gravitas of an employee’s role might be exemplified by simply showing him exactly how his output affects his coworkers further down the supply chain or the production line.


Every moment of your life is either a test or a celebration.


…Maslow coined [the term] “self-actualization” and John Rawls [coined] “self-realization” to refer to a person’s emerging mastery and unfolding scope. [They] understood that most, if not all, of the attainable self-realization in modern societies can come only from career… If a challenging career is not the main hope for self-realization, what else could be?


No one can put in his best performance unless he feels secure. “Se” comes from the Latin, meaning without… “Cure” means fear or care. “Secure” means “without fear,” not afraid to express ideas, not afraid to ask questions… Allow people to perform at their best by ensuring that they’re not afraid to express [their unique] ideas or concerns.


Ensure that your leaders are approachable… Break down barriers between [departments]. People [working in] research and design...must learn about the problems encountered…[by the people working in] production and assembly.


There is no other way to guard yourself against flattery than by making men understand that telling you the truth will not offend you.


Wasteful Motion: The employee should have a workstation in which everything he needs to complete his job is available to him. The assembly of a product should not require him to take a circuitous route—retrieving tools or parts from far-off corners of the factory.


Wasteful Transportation: Moving a product costs money. If your product is bouncing between suppliers and distributors or accruing needless shipping costs, then there is a problem in your logistical infrastructure.


Wasteful Waiting: In any production process, products often spend most of their lives merely waiting to be worked on. Try to eliminate such periods of inactivity whenever possible.


Wasteful Over-production: Have you produced more products than you need or more than the market demands? Work to properly gauge future demand.


Wasteful Over-processing: Providing a customer with added value can be beneficial. But if the added features are not obvious to the customer, then the product has been over-engineered.


Wasteful Inventory: The longer your product sits unused or unpurchased, the more money it’s costing you.


Wasteful Defects: A production line that produces too many duds is costly.


Figure 24 - The needle of success is typically advanced when resources are devoted to three things—product creation, sales, and marketing.


The most impactful actions tend to be in the domain of product creation, sales, and marketing.


Reach out to five satisfied customers and ask them if they can recommend someone else who might also be interested in your product or service. Compose an email to your existing customer base and tell them about a new product or service that you’d like to offer them. Work with your developer to identify an area in which your product is currently lacking. Then devise a plan to improve the product’s feature set.


People think “focus” means saying “yes” to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying “no” to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying “no” to 1,000 things.


After pushing on that flywheel in a consistent direction over an extended period of time, they’d inevitably hit a point of breakthrough.


Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.


Strategy emerges over time as intentions collide with (and accommodate) a changing reality.


What I’ve learned, above all, is to keep marching forward… [Though] chance does play a role, one important factor in success is under our control: the number of “at bats,” the number of chances taken, the number of opportunities seized. For even a coin weighted toward failure will sometimes land on success.


When participants committed to a “weekly goal” instead of a single long-term goal, then their chance of success went up by 22%. The subjects were more likely to stick with their New Year’s Resolution when the activity was to be completed in a small and measurable timeframe. For example, a goal to “lose five pounds each month” had a higher chance of success than a goal to simply “lose 20 pounds this year.”


As the management guru Peter Drucker liked to say: What gets measured gets managed.


In a 2013 research project led by Daniela Jakubowicz of Tel Aviv University, 93 obese or overweight women were placed into two groups and put on the same low-calorie diet. Only their breakfast and dinner portion sizes varied. The “Big Dinner” group was given a 200-calorie breakfast and a 700-calorie dinner. The “Big Breakfast” group was given a 700-calorie breakfast and a 200-calorie dinner. At the end of the twelve-week study, both groups had lost weight, but the “Big Breakfast” group had lost 11 more pounds than the “Big Dinner” group.


One clear communication from physicians could be, “If you want to lose weight, eat more in the morning than in the evening.”


Stand up more during the workday. To counteract the deleterious health effects of sitting at a desk all day, try conducting your work functions in a more elevated state. You might consider standing during some workday activities such as placing phone calls, waiting for printers to print, checking email, conducting meetings, or eating lunch. If you’re serious about keeping things vertical, consider taking the plunge and trading your office desk in for a “stand-up desk.”


Do not store unhealthy snacks in your proximity. One of the easiest ways to prevent yourself from snacking on high-calorie junk food is to simply make it inaccessible—i.e., don’t store any bags of chips, candies, or cookies in your home. This is not to say that you can never snack on these items. But buy them in single-serving portions and consume them immediately after purchase. By invoking this rule, we create a buffer between your appetite and the unhealthy food of your desire. The more footsteps that exist between you and the candy, the less likely you’ll be to eat it. Brian Wansink (author of Mindless Eating: Why We Eat More Than We Think) is famous for putting candy dishes near the desks of office workers and then recording them as they toss hundreds of empty calories into their mouths throughout the workday. It’s difficult for your lower brain to ignore such a tasty stimuli—especially when it is so proximate to your hand. So don’t put your brain through that. Instead, adhere to the old proverb: “out of sight, out of mind.”


Drink more water. The brain has trouble differentiating between a stomach full of food and a stomach full of water. Drinking a full glass of water (about 350 milliliters) before each meal may help to incite satiety.


Give your brain a minute to catch up with your stomach. Be mindful of the lag that exists between the swallowing of each bite of food and the onset of satiation. It’s commonly reported that it takes twenty minutes to experience the feeling of fullness. But the time will vary depending on many factors, including your personal physiology and the accessibility and novelty of the food on the table before you. If you’ve just devoured a slice of cake, and you’re currently eyeing a second slice, then try removing it from your field of view and make a deal with yourself—give yourself…


Ritualize the process of saving restaurant food for later. Retail sales for US restaurants and bars overtook grocery store sales in January of 2015. Meaning that Americans now spend more money eating out than they do eating in. When we dine at a restaurant or fast-food eatery, it is natural to want to consume every food item on the plate. But, given the absurdity of contemporary American portion sizes, there is usually too much to eat. In nearly every food category, US portion sizes have increased—often served in amounts that are 3 to 8 times larger than a standard FDA serving. Conventional dieting advice would propose that we simply eat less food—regardless of the amount that is served before us. But it is difficult to rationalize the expense of walking away from a half-eaten restaurant meal that has already been paid for. To account for these conflicting emotions, get in the habit of stowing a portion of your meal each time you eat out. Since restaurant doggie bags are typically not airtight, consider carrying a small Tupperware container…


What gets measured gets managed.


Kaizen is not a good approach to strength training if you’re about to star in a Hollywood superhero film. Kaizen techniques won’t be applicable if you’re entering a bodybuilding, boxing, or MMA competition next month. Kaizen will not get you to the Olympics. Instead, the Kaizen approach is for the rest of us; for those who seek to remain fit in perpetuity. And for those who are willing to commit to pursuing a lifetime of daily strength-training goals. The following four tips describe how to apply Kaizen to these objectives.


As the number of obstacles that stand between you and your workout machine increases, the chance that you will actually use the workout machine decreases.


Your workout area should be part of your life—not separate from it. Your home gym equipment should be located in the room you feel most comfortable in—preferably a well-trekked and temperature-controlled area that you frequently utilize, even when you’re not working out.


Your brain exists to help you survive, not to thrive. Your lizard brain doesn’t understand why you’re asking it to lift metal bars or run in a circle. No wild animal is chasing you. No band of marauders is hunting you down. So why are you running?


Tip #3: Track your daily fitness activity Throughout this book, we have repeatedly stressed the importance of tracking your results in every endeavor you pursue. Of course, when it comes to your strength-training goals, the same rule applies. Once you’ve decided to execute a workout regimen, it’s vital that you log your progress in some fashion.


It does not matter how slowly you go, so long as you do not stop.


Happiness and freedom begin with a clear understanding of one principle: Some things are within our control, and some things are not. It is only after you have faced up to this fundamental rule and learned to distinguish between what you can and cannot control that inner tranquility and outer effectiveness become possible.


God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.

Forgive others, not because they deserve forgiveness, but because you deserve peace.


The holes in your life are permanent. You have to grow around them, like tree roots around concrete; you mould yourself through the gaps.

Of all the virtues we can learn, no trait is more useful, more essential for survival, and more likely to improve the quality of life, than the ability to transform adversity into an enjoyable challenge.


With Lingchi (“death by a thousand cuts”), we learned that undesirable life outcomes do not typically originate from a single cause. Rather, thousands of offenses accumulate over long periods, ultimately resulting in a disastrous outcome. Hence, we should strive to remain cognizant of each little moral foible that occurs during the day. E.g., the little white lies we tell to our spouse, the extra bag of cookies consumed during lunch, and our mornings of workplace tardiness. When counted individually, each one of these infractions is almost always benign. But, when considered in aggregate, they can be injurious to our life goals.


With Hansei (“honest self-reflection”), we learned why it’s so important to take a moment to critically analyze our behaviors and identify areas of our life that could be improved upon. In conducting an honest appraisal of our past performance, we hope to gain some perspective about our current strengths and weaknesses. This data helps us to plot a viable course down the path of self-improvement.


With Ikigai (“your true calling”), we discussed how the citizens of Okinawa, Japan find their “reason to get out of bed in the morning” by discovering a personal passion project. While our passion may sometimes call upon us to suffer for our craft, it can also stir the forces of intrinsic motivation within us and impel us to achieve impressive feats. This mindset helps to keep us productive—even when times are tough or on the days when our muse is not so easily aroused.


With Kaizen (“continuous improvement”), we mastered the art of goal setting via a commitment to daily incremental progress. And we learned that even the most difficult obstacles can be atomized—broken down into manageable tasks to be completed bit by bit. By attacking the smallest objectives first, we build up a repository of psychological momentum which motivates us to advance on to increasingly more difficult challenges.


Life is hard. It’s tainted by malevolence and betrayal. That can make you bitter. You need a meaning to offset that. Where is the meaning to be found? Not in rights, not in impulsive pleasures, but in responsibility. You take responsibility for yourself… If you’re good at it, you have some excess left over to take care of your family. If you’re good at both of those, then you have some excess left over to take care of your community. Those are heavy burdens… The purpose of life is to find the largest burden that you can bear, and then bear it… The best way to pick up the burden is to continuously improve yourself. And that’s where the meaning is to be found… The meaning is in the continual self-transcendence. The American psychologist Pamela G. Reed defined “self-transcendence” as: The capacity to expand self-boundaries…toward a greater awareness of one’s philosophy, values, and dreams…


We all know that after the honeymoon comes the marriage [and] after the election comes the hard task of governance. In spiritual life it is the same: After the ecstasy comes the laundry.
