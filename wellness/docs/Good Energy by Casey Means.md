# Good Energy by Casey Means

Metabolic syndrome means cells are struggling to get their jobs done because of problems in their energy production system. Metabolic syndrome is clinically defined as having three or more of the following traits: Fasting glucose of 100 mg/dL or higher A waistline of more than 35 inches for women and 40 inches for men HDL cholesterol less than 40 mg/dL for men and 50 mg/dL for women Triglycerides of 150 mg/dL or higher Blood pressure of 130/85 mmHg or higher


In terms of what raises triglyceride levels, the simple message is that high triglycerides are almost certainly a warning sign that you are eating too much sugar, refined carbs, and/or alcohol, and probably not engaging in enough physical activity.

RANGES: The triglyceride range that’s considered “normal” by standard criteria: <150 mg/dL Optimal range: <80 mg/dL


RANGES: Range considered “normal” by standard criteria: <100 mg/dL Optimal range: 70–85 mg/dL We call blood sugar less than 100 mg/dL “normal.” That’s another travesty. As Dr. Robert Lustig says, “Once the fasting glucose rises over 100 mg/dL (signifying prediabetes), metabolic syndrome is in full force, and there are no options for prevention anymore; now you’re in full-fledged treatment mode. But in fact, a fasting blood glucose of 90 mg/dL is already questionable.”


Bad Energy processes make this worse: increased inflammation leads to high blood pressure by downregulating nitric oxide synthase (the protein enzyme that makes nitric oxide), and oxidative stress induces hypertension by causing damage to blood vessel walls and decreasing nitric oxide. RANGES: Range considered “normal” by standard criteria: <120 systolic and <80 diastolic mmHg Optimal range: Same as “normal”


RANGES: Range considered “normal” by standard criteria: <102 cm (40 inches) for men and <88 cm (35 inches) for women Optimal range: The International Diabetes Federation has proposed tighter cut points of <80 cm (31.5 inches) for women and <90 cm (35 inches) for men of the following ethnicities: South Asian, Chinese, Japanese, and South and Central Americans. For those of European, Sub-Saharan African, Middle Eastern, and Eastern Mediterranean origin, the cut points are <94 cm (37 inches) in men and <80 cm (31.5 inches) in women.


Perplexingly, the triglyceride-to-HDL ratio is not a metric used in standard clinical practice. If you remember one thing from this chapter, remember this: you need to know your insulin sensitivity. It can give you lifesaving clues about early dysfunction and Bad Energy brewing in your body, and is best assessed by a fasting insulin test, discussed below.


RANGES: Range considered “normal” by standard criteria: none specified in standard criteria Optimal range: Anything above a ratio of 3 is strongly suggestive of insulin resistance. You want to shoot for less than 1.5, although lower is better. I recommend aiming for less than 1. My HDL cholesterol is 92 mg/dL and triglycerides are 47 mg/dL, making my ratio 0.51.


RANGES (FASTING INSULIN): No standardized range for “normal,” but according to some sources, <25 mIU/L Optimal range: fasting insulin 2 to 5 mIU/L. Above 10 mIU/L is concerning, and above 15 mIU/L is significantly elevated. RANGES (HOMA-IR): Less than 2.0, but lower is better


RANGES: Range considered “normal” by standard criteria: The CDC and American Heart Association recommend the following ranges: Low risk: <1.0 mg/L Average risk: 1.0 to 3.0 mg/L High risk: >3.0 mg/L Optimal range: <0.3 mg/L. This level is one you want as low as possible, and certainly below the “low-risk” range indicated by the CDC. A study of nearly thirty thousand individuals showed that very low hsCRP (<0.36 mg/L) was associated with the least risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke, and the risk steadily increased from there. Even a range of 0.36 to 0.64 mg/L conferred higher risk than <0.36 mg/L, and by the time one reached 0.64 to 1.0 mg/L, the relative risk was 2.6 for a cardiovascular event.


RANGES: Range considered “normal” by standard criteria: usually around 1.5 to 6 mg/dL for women and 2.5 to 6 mg/dL for men Optimal range: Research suggests that keeping uric acid <5 mg/dL for men and 2 to 4 mg/dL for women is associated with the lowest development of cardiometabolic diseases.


RANGES: Range considered “normal” by standard criteria: the Mayo Clinic states that normal ALT is 7 to 55 U/L, AST is 8 to 48 U/L, and GGT is 8 to 61 U/L. Optimal range: Research suggests that all-cause mortality starkly increases when AST and ALT levels rise above about 17 U/L. For GGT, lowest risk for men is about <25 U/L and women <14 to 20 U/L. Some sources recommend <8 U/L. Sources vary, but these are good targets to aim for.


RANGES: Range considered “normal” by standard criteria: the NIH recommends levels from 20 to 50 ng/mL. Optimal range: research suggests that vitamin D levels from 40 to 60 ng/mL are associated with the lowest all-cause mortality. Vitamin D toxicity is generally not observed until levels are much higher.


Use a wearable step and sleep tracker (examples listed on this page) to understand your average steps per day, with a goal of getting a bare minimum of 7,000 steps per day, and ultimately working up to 10,000 steps per day. Researchers are still debating whether step count matters. I hope to put this debate to rest. In a study of 2,110 adults followed for almost eleven years,


Number of Cardiovascular Minutes per Day and Week Research strongly suggests that a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity per week is crucial for cardiometabolic health (and is as effective as antidepressant medication for mood), which translates into about 30 minutes, five days a week. Wearables that track heart rate can help you know if you are getting this amount per week.


Research has shown that having a lower resting heart rate can improve overall life span and metabolic health. A higher resting heart rate is associated with an increased risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and all-cause mortality.


In a meta-analysis of over one million people, all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality increased linearly and significantly for any resting heart rate above 45 bpm.


Recap: Recommended Ranges Below are recommended optimal ranges for key metabolic blood tests. Falling outside of these ranges is an indicator that you could have brewing dysfunction. The remainder of Part 2 and the plan in Part 3 will give specific steps to increase Good Energy and improve these biomarkers: Triglycerides: Less than 80 mg/dL HDL: 50 to 90 mg/dL Fasting Glucose: 70 to 85 mg/dL Blood Pressure: Less than 120 systolic and less than 80 diastolic mmHg Waist Circumference: <80 cm (31.5 inches) for women and <90 cm (35 inches) for men (South Asian, Chinese, Japanese, and South and Central Americans) <80 cm (31.5 inches) for women and <94 cm (37 inches) for men (European, Sub-Saharan African, Middle Eastern, and Eastern Mediterranean) Triglyceride-to-HDL Ratio: Below 1.5. Above 3 is a clear sign of metabolic dysfunction. Fasting Insulin: From 2 to 5 mIU/L. Above 10 mIU/L is concerning and above 15 mIU/L is significantly elevated. HOMA-IR: Less than 2.0 High-Sensitivity CRP (hsCRP): Less than 0.3 mg/dL Hemoglobin A1c: From 5.0 to 5.4 percent Uric Acid: Less than 5 mg/dL for men, and from 2 to 4 mg/dL for women Liver Enzymes: aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) AST and ALT levels of 17 U/L or less. For GGT, lowest risk for men is less than 25 U/L and women from 14 to 20 U/L. Sources vary slightly, but these are good targets to aim for. Vitamin D 40 to 60 ng/mL Recommended real-time metrics to track: Glucose (continuous glucose monitor) Food (food journal or app) Sleep (quantity, quality, consistency) Activity (steps, number of active minutes per day and week with elevated heart rate) Resting heart rate and heart rate variability


So often, doctors and patients are taught that genes are our destiny—but that’s not true. Our genes don’t determine most health outcomes. What we eat and how we live impact our gene expression and cellular biology, determining our outcomes.


I believe the United States would be a healthier, happier, more prosperous place if we replaced all those studies with these simple guidelines that will transform anyone’s health. Eat the following: Organic (ideally regenerative) unrefined or minimally refined fruits Organic (ideally regenerative) unrefined or minimally refined vegetables Organic (ideally regenerative) unrefined or minimally refined nuts and seeds Organic (ideally regenerative) unrefined or minimally refined legumes and beans Pasture-raised, organic, 100 percent grass-fed meats and organs, including elk, venison, bison, lamb, beef, pork, goat Pasture-raised, organic, 100 percent foraging poultry and eggs Pasture-raised, organic, 100 percent grass-fed, ideally A2-strain dairy products like milk, cheese, yogurt, and kefir Wild, line-caught, small omega-3 fish, including mackerel, sardines, anchovies, and salmon Organic unrefined or minimally refined herbs and spices Organic minimally refined condiments, like vinegar, mustard, and hot sauce Organic (ideally regenerative) minimally refined fermented foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, yogurt, natto, tempeh, tofu, and kefir Reverse osmosis or charcoal-filtered water


Cut processed and ultra-processed foods from your diet—particularly those that contain the following: Refined sugars of any kind Refined grains of any kind Refined industrial vegetable or seed oils of any kind


Choose a yogurt that is organic, has minimal ingredients (ideally just milk and cultures), has no added sugar, and says “live active cultures” on the label.


STOCKING THE GOOD ENERGY KITCHEN Here are a few of my favorite ways to get organic food as cheaply as possible. Buy frozen organic fruits, vegetables, meats, and wild-caught fish in bulk, or buy fresh and freeze. I get four pounds of organic frozen cauliflower rice weekly at Costco for under $10, which makes close to eight meals. Cook large batches of organic beans or lentils in the slow cooker or stovetop. Bulk organic beans and lentils are often less than $4 per pound. Purchase the cheapest organic nuts and seeds in bulk. For instance, organic pine nuts can be upward of $44 per pound, while organic flax and chia seeds are often less than $6 per pound. Purchase whatever organic produce happens to be on sale. Doing so has had the added benefit of getting me to try new foods! Buy wild-caught canned fish, like salmon, instead of fresh fish. Join a community-sponsored agriculture (CSA) program or sign up for an organic produce delivery service that ships misshapen foods that otherwise would go to waste (like Imperfect Foods). Replace meat and fish with plant-based proteins, like beans and lentils, for some meals to cut costs. Talk to farmers at the farmers’ market to get the best deals. Farmers will often reduce the price of certain items that they have in excess that week. Additionally, there are many farms that use no synthetic pesticides but have not gone through the costly and lengthy process to obtain official USDA organic certification. Their products will be chemical-free and

Bad Energy Foods If you remember one food principle in this book, remember that cutting the unholy trinity of these three ingredients from your diet will completely change your health and ensure you’re making room for more Good Energy foods: Refined added sugar Refined industrial vegetable and seed oils Refined grains


Liquid Calories Liquids make up 22 percent of the American diet, and almost all liquids, aside from water, black coffee, and unsweetened tea, contain empty calories that promote bad energy with no benefits. Not drinking your calories is one of the simplest and easiest cuts to reduce sugar and other chemicals that hurt energy regulation.


REFINED GRAIN PRODUCT: White bread GOOD ENERGY SWAP Bread made from nut flours (like almond) or coconut flour Sweet potatoes cut lengthwise and baked can make a bread alternative Coconut Flour Flatbread


REFINED GRAIN PRODUCT: Flour tortillas or taco shells GOOD ENERGY SWAP Seaweed sheets (nori) Butter lettuce wraps Collard green wraps Jicama wraps (e.g., Trader Joe’s) Egg wraps (e.g., Crepini Organic Petit Egg Wraps with Cauliflower) Lentil wraps (e.g., 2-Ingredient Lentil Wraps from ElaVegan.com) Flax wraps (e.g., Flaxseed Wraps from SweetAsHoney.co) Spinach-Chickpea Wraps


REFINED GRAIN PRODUCT: White rice GOOD ENERGY SWAP Cauliflower rice (buy frozen, or pulse cauliflower florets in food processor until rice-like; see recipe on this page) Broccoli rice (buy frozen, or pulse broccoli stems in food processor until rice-like) Shirataki rice, made from high-fiber konjac root (e.g., Miracle Noodle brand) Sweet potato rice (pulse sweet potato in food processor until rice-like)


REFINED GRAIN PRODUCT: Pasta GOOD ENERGY SWAP Zucchini noodles Sweet potato noodles Beet noodles Parsnip noodles Note: the four noodles above are made with an inexpensive spiralizer device that I highly recommend purchasing to make a range of healthy noodles from vegetables. Spaghetti squash (roast and scrape out squash flesh with a fork for noodle-like consistency) Chickpea pasta Lupini bean pasta (e.g., Kaizen Food brand) Lentil pasta Black bean pasta Hearts of palm pasta (e.g., Trader Joe’s, Palmini, and Thrive Market all make this type of pasta) Konjac root pasta (also sometimes called miracle noodles or shirataki noodles; e.g., Thrive Market brand or nuPasta) Kelp noodles (e.g., Sea Tangle Noodle Company)

REFINED GRAIN PRODUCT: Cereal or instant oatmeal GOOD ENERGY SWAP Chia seed or basil seed pudding Grain-free granola made with nuts and seeds No-oat oatmeal made with nuts, seeds, and coconut flakes


Don’t Eat “Naked Carbohydrates”: Naked carbohydrates are carbohydrate-predominant foods that are eaten alone, like a banana (of which 92 percent of calories are from carbohydrates) or other fruits. Pair these carb-rich foods with healthy protein, fats, and/or fiber to slow digestion, increase satiety, and reduce the influx of glucose in the bloodstream.


Try these simple ways to preload meals: Always order a salad filled with greens and some protein (egg, chicken, cheese) before eating a starchy entrée. Make sure the dressing has no sugar. Ask the waiter not to bring bread or chips before a meal. If your plate includes a starch (e.g., potato or pasta), protein (e.g., chicken or fish), and vegetable, start with the vegetable, then eat the protein, and then end with the starch. Eat a handful of nuts, a hard-boiled egg, or some chopped veggies about a half hour before sitting down to a meal or going to an event.

Add Fiber to All Meals: Fiber slows digestion, promotes microbiome health, and lowers post-meal glucose rises.


Recap: Creating a Good Energy Meal Good Energy Foods: Micronutrients and antioxidants (see these pages for comprehensive lists) Omega-3 fatty acids (see these pages for top foods) Fiber (see this page for top foods) Fermented foods (see these pages for top foods) Protein (see this page for top foods) Bad Energy Foods: Refined added sugar Refined industrial vegetable and seed oils Refined grains


More light in the morning and less at night signals to the SCN what time of day it is and sets our bodies up to time genetic and hormonal signals appropriately. Simply put: a key way that you regulate your hormones, metabolism, weight, and risk for disease is by showing your cells what time it is by exposing your eyeballs to direct sunlight throughout the light part of the day and by hiding your eyeballs from as much light as possible when the sun is down.


Quantity We need to get seven to eight hours a night of good-quality sleep for our bodies to be protected from Bad Energy physiology. Sleep deprivation almost immediately impacts our ability to make energy, with studies showing that sleep deprivation decreases ATP production in several brain regions in mice.


Quality Minimally interrupted sleep is also a critical component of metabolic health. Reduced sleep quality is linked to Bad Energy conditions such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, heart disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and stroke. One study followed over two thousand adult men for eight years and found that subjects who reported difficulty maintaining sleep had a twofold to threefold higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes.


Simply walking about 10,000 steps per day (as compared with lower amounts) is associated with the following: 50 percent lower dementia risk 50 to 70 percent lower risk of premature death 44 percent lower risk of getting type 2 diabetes 31 percent (or more) lower risk of obesity Significant reductions in cancer occurrence, major depression, gastric reflux, and sleep apnea


Keep It Simple With food, we covered three simple rules that get you quite far: don’t eat added sugar, don’t eat industrially processed vegetable and seed oils, and don’t eat highly processed grains.


With fitness, I also suggest three simple rules. Walk at least 7,000 steps per day and space these steps out throughout the day. Work up to 10,000 per day. Get your heart rate above 60 percent of your maximum for at least 150 minutes a week. (That’s 30 minutes, five days a week.) Lift heavy things multiple times per week in a way that hits every major muscle group.


At the end of your showers, turn the water to cold for two minutes. This is how my coauthor, Calley, started doing regular cold exposure, and he came out of the shower feeling great and ended up looking forward to it.

Principles for Replenishing What Modernity Took Away Exercise Principles: Moderate intensity movement for at least 150 minutes per week Calculate your max heart rate by subtracting your age from 220, and then determining what 64 percent of this is, which is the floor for moderate-intensity movement. Log 10,000 steps per day. Measurable on any fitness tracker. Move a little bit during at least eight hours every day. Measurable on any fitness tracker. Aim for resistance training three times per week. Incorporate exercises that fatigue the arms, legs, and core every week. You can resistance train with body-weight exercises or with weights.


Temperature Principles: Get at least one cumulative hour per week of heat exposure. This can be through a dry sauna, infrared sauna, or a heated exercise class like hot yoga. Get at least twelve cumulative minutes per week of cold exposure. This can be through cryotherapy, cold showers, or cold immersion in a cold plunge tub or cold body of water (like a lake, river, or pool in winter).


Toxins Principles: Filter air and water in your home. Using an activated charcoal filter and reverse osmosis are the best options for water, and a HEPA filter for air. Eat unprocessed organic or regeneratively grown food. Avoid plastics wherever possible; opt for glass or other materials instead. Take stock of the plastic products in your home, closet, and kitchen and work to minimize.


Good Energy Habits Nutrition Eliminate refined added sugars Eliminate all foods, drinks, and condiments with refined or liquid sugars. Added sugars may include the following names: white sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, cane sugar, evaporated cane juice, raw sugar, turbinado sugar, demerara sugar, coconut sugar, maple syrup, honey, molasses, agave nectar, corn syrup, high-fructose corn syrup, glucose, dextrose, fructose, maltose, sucrose, galactose, maltodextrin, lactose, caramel, barley malt, rice syrup, date sugar, beet sugar, invert sugar, and golden syrup. Read all labels for any “added sugars,” and do not buy any products with them. Remove anything with added sugar from your home and throw them away. Track this through your food journal.


Eliminate refined grains Eliminate all foods with ultra-processed refined flour or grain. These include all standard breads (white, wheat, and whole wheat), rice (white and brown), pasta, bagels, tortillas, crackers, cereals, pretzels, doughnuts, cookies, cakes, pastries, pizza crusts, waffles, pancakes, croissants, English muffins, hamburger buns, hot dog buns, and muffins. Ingredients on packaged food might include: wheat flour, all-purpose flour, self-rising flour, bread flour, cake flour, pastry flour, whole wheat flour, semolina flour, farina, durum wheat flour, spelt flour, barley flour, rye flour, rice flour, oat flour, or buckwheat flour. Read all labels closely. Track this through your food journal.


Eliminate industrial seed oils Eliminate all foods, drinks, and condiments with refined industrially manufactured seed oils. These include: soybean oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, peanut oil, grapeseed oil, and any oil that says “hydrogenated.” Refined seed oils are found in a wide variety of foods, including many store-bought salad dressings, mayonnaise, hummus, dips, potato chips, peanut butter, corn chips, crackers, granola bars, cookies, pastries, muffins, doughnuts, fried chicken, chicken nuggets, chicken tenders, fish sticks, frozen pizza, french fries, packaged popcorn, tortilla chips, cheese puffs, snack mixes, vegetable chips, canned soups, instant noodles, cakes, brownies, pancakes, waffles, butter alternatives, packaged muffins, cookies, croissants, biscuits, and roasted nuts. Track this through your food journal.


Eat over 50 grams of fiber per day Track fiber intake daily and aim to get 50 grams per day or more from food sources. If getting 50 grams of fiber initially causes bloating or stomach upset, you may want to start slow, with 30 grams per day from foods like avocados, raspberries, and chia seeds, and work up to beans and legumes (which some people find “gassy”) and higher quantities of fiber. Using a barcode-scanning app like MacroFactor can make this extremely simple, as it will automatically pull in the fiber content. Best sources to maximize fiber are beans, legumes, nuts and seeds, and certain fruits. Specific foods with high fiber include: Navy beans (~10 grams per ½ cup) Black beans (~7.5 grams per ½ cup) Chia seeds (8 grams per 2 tablespoons) Basil seeds (15 grams per 2 tablespoons; I use Zen Basil brand) Flaxseeds (8 grams per 1 ounce) Lentils (~15 grams per 1 cooked cup) Raspberries and blackberries (~8 grams per 1 cup) Brussels sprouts (6 grams per 1 cooked cup) Broccoli (5 grams per 1 cooked cup) Avocados (~13 grams per avocado) Track fiber intake in your food journal.


Eat three or more servings of probiotic foods per day Ensure you are getting three or more servings of probiotic-rich foods that do not have added sugar every day. Sources include yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, miso, tempeh, natto, kvass, and apple cider vinegar.


Increase omega-3 intake to a minimum of 2 grams per day


Movement Engage in moderate-intensity movement for at least 150 minutes per week Calculate your maximum heart rate by subtracting your age from 220, and then determine what 64 percent of that number is, which is the floor for moderate-intensity movement. For me, that would be 220 – 35 = 185 x 0.64 = 118 bpm. For me, this means I need to get my heart rate above 118 bpm for 150 minutes a week at a minimum. Trying out different activities with your wearable tracker can help you learn what “moderate” activity feels like. For me, a brisk flat walk does not get me to 118 bpm, but a brisk walk up a hill or a flat jog does. Verify your time at a specific heart rate range with your wearable, and log your time each day in your Good Energy tracker.


Resistance train three times per week Commit to resistance training twice per week or more for at least thirty minutes each session. Incorporate exercises that fatigue the arms, legs, and core every week. This can be done with body-weight exercises or with weights. There are numerous options for starting a resistance training program with online classes, in-person classes, personal training, and resistance-focused gyms. I’ve recommended several in the supplementary materials at caseymeans.com/goodenergy. Make sure that the sessions are planned and scheduled before week three begins. This may mean signing up for classes at a local gym, finding a free YouTube series you like that uses just body-weight training, signing up for an online resistance training program, or other avenues. Log your resistance training in your Good Energy tracker.


Take 10,000 steps per day For the month, commit to getting 10,000 steps a day, verified by a wearable tracker. Tip: Splitting walks up into short spurts throughout the day makes this very simple. If you walk around the block twice in the morning while drinking your coffee, you’ll likely accrue around 1,000 steps. Walking the perimeter of your house or apartment while brushing your teeth for two or three minutes can get you 300 to 500 steps. Walking while taking a thirty-minute phone call will accrue anywhere from 2,000 to…


Move regularly throughout the day Commit to getting up and moving around for at least ninety seconds every hour for eight waking hours per day. This is surprisingly hard if you have a desk job, where it’s easy to let hours go by without standing up. One of the best parts of wearables like the Apple Watch and Fitbit is that they specifically tell you how many hours you got up and moved. Based on this information, you can see if any parts of your day are particularly sedentary. For me, my wearables have shown me that my most sedentary hours are from 2:00 to 5:00 p.m., so now I can troubleshoot those hours. You can set a timer on…


Sleep Get seven to eight hours of sleep per night, confirmed by a sleep tracker You will aim to get between seven and eight hours of total sleep every single night, as tracked by a wearable tracker. Wearables will show you how much of the night you were awake, tossing and turning, which is subtracted from total sleep time and is important to account for. Going to bed at 11:00 p.m and getting up at 7:00 a.m. does not translate to eight hours of sleep. This is a habit that may take extreme levels of boundary setting, like going to bed earlier than other people in your household or sleeping in longer. It may require you to keep pets out of your bedroom…


Get consistent sleep, with regular bedtimes and wake times Adhere to a set one-hour bedtime and wake time window to minimize social jet lag. This could be a bedtime between 10:00 and 11:00 p.m. and a wake time…


Stress, Relationships, and Emotional Health Meditate daily For the month, practice meditation with a guided app or meditation group every day, for a minimum of ten minutes per day. In doing this practice, you build the powerful capacity to understand that you are an observer of your thoughts, and that they are not your identity. This awareness is a liberating first step in getting out of the “autopilot” of thought patterns that many of us are in and suffer from. Additionally, meditations focused on the breath can be…


Light Maximize sunlight exposure in the daytime Spend at least fifteen minutes outdoors without sunglasses on during the first hour after waking every day. If the sun is not up when you wake, then you should aim to be outside for fifteen minutes during or just after sunrise, and/or turn on bright lights or a light box upon waking. Get outside in the daylight for at least fifteen minutes four additional times per day, for a total of at least one cumulative hour outside per day. This could look like working out outside, eating breakfast and/or lunch outdoors, taking a walk, gardening, or taking phone calls outside. It is so easy to let a day go by without spending a full hour outside in at least four fifteen-minute chunks. Find ways to move your indoor activities to the outdoors, or front-load your outdoor activities to the first hour of the day.


Minimize nighttime blue light Wear blue-light-blocking glasses between sundown and bedtime. (See recommendations for glasses at caseymeans .com/goodenergy) After the sun goes down, turn off any unnecessary lights and dim necessary lights to a low level. Add dimmers to your home lights if you can. Turn all screens (computer, phone, tablet) to “dark mode” or “night shift” after the sun goes down.


Temperature Get heat exposure for at least one cumulative hour per week Aim to get one cumulative hour of very hot heat exposure per week. This can be through a dry sauna, infrared sauna, or a heated exercise class like hot yoga. In weeks one and two, find a facility or gym that has access to a sauna or heat therapy and arrange for your sessions for weeks three and four. The heat should be hot enough that you feel uncomfortable and are sweating significantly.


Get cold exposure for at least twelve cumulative minutes per week Aim to get twelve cumulative minutes of very cold exposure per week. This can be through cryotherapy, cold showers, or cold immersion in a cold plunge tub or cold body of water (like a lake, river, or pool in winter). If you choose to do cryotherapy or cold immersion, you’ll want to find a facility to do so and arrange this before weeks three and four. If you go into a body of water for a cold plunge, don’t go alone. Make sure you are safe! When I moved to Oregon, I found a group on Meetup that cold plunged together several days per week, and I joined in. How cold should it be? It should feel like an extreme challenge that you want to escape. Aim for an eventual goal temperature of 35°F to 45°F for three minutes per session.
