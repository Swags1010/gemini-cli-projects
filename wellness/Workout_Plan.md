### Your Weekly Workout Schedule

Alternate the following workouts throughout the week. Aim for 3-4 sessions per week on non-consecutive days to allow for recovery. A post-workout walk with your dog is a great way to cool down.

*   **Day 3:** Workout B
*   **Day 4:** Rest
*   **Day 5:** Workout A or B (alternate from previous)

### **Workout A: Full Body Strength**

**Equipment:** 55 lb Kettlebell, 35 lb Kettlebell, Pull-up Bar, Weighted Vest

Complete as many rounds as possible (AMRAP) in 20 minutes, followed by a 5-minute cool-down.

1.  **Kettlebell Goblet Squats:** 10 reps
    *   **Use your 55 lb kettlebell.** Hold it close to your chest. Keep your back straight and chest up as you squat.
2.  **Pull-ups:** 5 reps
    *   **For an extra challenge, wear your weighted vest.** If 5 reps are too difficult, do them without the vest, or do assisted pull-ups.
3.  **Kettlebell Swings:** 15 reps
    *   **Use a 35 lb kettlebell.** Focus on a powerful hip hinge; the power comes from your hips, not your arms.
4.  **Push-ups:** 10 reps
    *   **Wear your weighted vest to increase the difficulty.** Keep your core tight and your body in a straight line.

    *   **Use a 35 lb kettlebell.** Start with it in the "rack" position at your shoulder and press straight overhead.
2.  **Kettlebell Lunges:** 8 reps per leg
    *   **Hold a 35 lb kettlebell in each hand.** This will challenge your balance and core.

    *   1 minute: Walk or light jog to recover (e.g., 3-4 mph)
*   **Minutes 20-25:** Cool-down (light jog or walk)
