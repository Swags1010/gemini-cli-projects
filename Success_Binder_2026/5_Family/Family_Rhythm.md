# The Wagner Family Rhythm

This is a simple guide to our non-negotiable family commitments. This is what we protect.

## Daily Rhythms

*   **Family Dinner:** We eat together at the table with no phones or screens. This is our time to connect.
*   **Charlotte's Bedtime:** We read to Charlotte every single night.

## Weekly Rhythms

*   **Date Night:** One night a week (or every other week) is reserved for Sami and Nick. This can be a night out or a planned night in, but it is intentional time together.
*   **Unplugged Weekend:** We have at least one hour of "deep play" time every weekend with no devices. This could be a family walk, playing in the yard, or building a fort.
*   **Goose's Adventure:** Goose gets a long walk or a trip to the park at least once on the weekend.
