# The Six Habits of Highly Effective Sales Engineers by Chris White

Partner – Habit #1 is to partner with your sales counterpart. To think of your relationship with your sales counterpart as a partnership. Sales is a team sport, and you are on the same team. In this section, we will examine the different perspectives each player brings to the table, identify some mistakes to avoid, and offer a process for collaboration.


Probe – Habit #2 is to probe into any request for a demonstration. It is the habit of digging into a customers’ objectives, requirements, expectations, etc. We do this by hosting a Technical Discovery Call, which we will discuss at great length. In the section, I will provide specific guidance on how to execute technical discovery, offer a list of questions you can use, and discuss other important clues to be on the lookout for that will shape how and what you demonstrate.


Prepare – Habit #3 is to prepare with effectiveness and efficiency in mind. This requires a very keen understanding of the difference between preparing demo content vs. preparing the demo script or story. In this chapter, I will reveal the most common mistakes SEs make and time wasters that interfere with preparing for demos. We’ll walk through a plan for how to stay laser focused.


Practice – Habit #4 is the easiest in nature, but too important to leave out. The most consistently successful SE’s practice their demos religiously. They understand that technical issues in a demo can delay or crush a deal. Before a demo, they make sure to “click every click.” In this section, I will unveil the one thing you don’t want after a click and offer specific tips for what to look for when “spot checking” your demos.


Perform – Habit #5 is to perform under the spotlight. The most successful SE’s understand that a demo is more than a technical presentation, it’s a performance. There are very specific things that we need to do, say, and avoid in order to earn the trust of your customers and the respect of your colleagues. In this chapter I will arm you with 20 specific tips and, techniques and best practices that will elevate you to technical presales superstar status.


Perfect – Habit #6 is to consistently perfect your trade. It’s based on the principle of constant improvement. Top performing SE’s consistently seek to learn and improve. They collaborate with their sales counterparts and constantly evaluate their performance.


But the number one goal—our MAIN objective as sales engineers, what we are ultimately responsible for, and what we will use for the basis of this book—is to get (what I like to refer to as) the TECHNICAL WIN.

The technical win is to convince the prospect that your solution will meet their needs, solve their problems, and help them achieve their objectives.

**Tags:** orange


It is simply to show them – no, CONVINCE them – that your software, solutions, and company will meet their requirements, solve their problems, and enable them to achieve their desired outcomes.

**Tags:** orange


Here’s the thing, however, we are no longer in the problem-solving business; we are in the convincing business. This requires different muscles, different skills, and different approaches.

**Tags:** orange


A key aspect of the “technical win”, in fact, an addendum to the definition above, is “to convince your prospects that the business value of the solution outweighs or justifies the investment”.

**Tags:** orange


It begins by establishing trust and building confidence with our audience – that is, the prospects and/or customers that we are working with. As a rule of thumb, we are going to be given the benefit of the doubt in most cases, because we’re the “technical expert,” and not the “sales guy.” But at the same time, we must earn it. We must earn their trust and confidence.

**Tags:** orange


We also focus too much on the thing and not the story, i.e., the product and not the message.

**Tags:** orange


We confuse presales for training. We come by this honestly. Many of us come from a consulting or technical support background. We are used to providing training on software tools. But a sales demonstration is NOT training. The goal is NOT to teach the audience how to use the tool. It's to get them excited. It’s to show them what's possible. It's to get them to say yes.

**Tags:** orange


We dive too deeply into their problems – especially in the context of preparing for a product demonstration. We forget to leave full problem solving to the post-sales consultants.

**Tags:** orange


We treat every customer or opportunity the same. We approach every demo the same. In technical presales one size does not fit all. Every customer is different. Every situation is unique. What makes one prospect say YES may be very different from what will make another say yes.

**Tags:** orange


The first habit of highly effective SEs is to PARTNER with your sales counterparts. Treat these relationships as partnerships. The most successful SEs understand that they are in sales and recognize their role on the team. They understand that not unlike other partnerships – such as a marriage – it requires collaboration, give and take, negotiation, communication, etc.

**Tags:** orange


So, what are we to do? How do we adopt and develop Habit #1 to PARTNER with our sales counterparts? There are three things we need to do, a) get your mindset right, b) clarify roles and responsibilities, and c) follow a process.

**Tags:** orange


Use this list of questions to assess the opportunity.   Who are we talking to? What is their role/level? Are they technical? Management? Executive level? What are they trying to accomplish? How long have we been talking to them? Have they seen our product or a demonstration before? Are they current customers? Are they familiar with our product or have they seen or used a product like ours? Is a third party or consultant involved? In what stage is the opportunity? Is there a budget and project tied to the opportunity? Are we talking to the decision makers? Are they on a timeline?

**Tags:** orange


Get the right mindset – Sales is a Team Sport Discuss and clarify roles and responsibilities – with your sales counterparts, sales management and fellow SEs Map out a sales process – or review the sales process Identify your responsibilities in each step of the process

**Tags:** orange


The second habit may very well be the most important thing we can do to position ourselves to achieve the technical win. Habit #2 is to PROBE into the requirements of any request for a demo from a prospective client or customer.

**Tags:** orange


The goal of the technical discovery call is to determine what it is that we need to SAY, SHOW and DO, in order to get the technical win.

**Tags:** orange


He/she who buys a shovel doesn’t want a shovel. They want a hole. But they don’t just want a hole, they want a fence or a tree. But they don’t just want a fence or a tree, they want privacy, or shad, or fruit, or flowers.  Yet we show up wanting to talk about the shiny shovel!

**Tags:** orange


Then once you’re armed with all the information your colleague has gathered to date, you’re going to use that as part of the discovery call. Keep in mind you want to be as efficient with the prospect’s time as you possibly can. Try to keep the technical discovery call to about 30 minutes.   INSIGHT: I’ve had to say this countless times to the sales folks that I work with, and I’ll share with you now. If a prospect isn’t willing to spend 30 minutes on the phone with the technical expert who’s going to give the demonstration – to clarify the requirements and expectations. Then there’s no way on earth that that customer is going to spend any money on your solution. Period. To me, it’s an indication of how serious – or NOT – a prospective client really is.

**Tags:** orange


INSIGHT: No matter where the prospect goes with his/her answer to the first question, your next question needs to correlate to something they said in their answer.

**Tags:** orange


During the technical discovery call, now is NOT the time to sell. Now is NOT the time to solve. Now is the time to ASK QUESTIONS. Probe deeper into their responses. And collect the information you need to create the most compelling, engaging, spot-on demo as possible.

**Tags:** orange


Could I trouble you to provide me with an overview of the project in your own words? Is it possible to provide some background as to why you're looking at tools such as ours? Does the organization have any previous experience with other tools or solutions like ours? If so, how did it go? If it failed, why? At the end of the day, what are you hoping to accomplish with this solution or with this project? What does success look like for your organization? Are there specific industry standards, frameworks, or guidelines that you are required to do or attempting to follow? Are you even familiar with them and are they important to you? Are there certain business areas, domains, or internal organizations that you are targeting or focusing on to begin with? Will the business context of the demonstration make a difference to you and your group? (As an example, if they are an insurance agency, will a demonstration that includes sample data from a fictitious manufacturing company make it difficult for them to follow?) If so, do they have any sample data that they could provide to be included in the demonstration? Are there specific capabilities that you're looking for? Who’s going to be in attendance? What are their roles? Are they hand-on users, technical principals, management, decision makers, etc.? What are the meeting logistics? Is it a secure environment? Will I have internet access? Are we meeting in a conference room or someone’s office?

**Tags:** orange


Another mistake I’ve seen SEs make when trying to run a technical discovery call is, they ask questions in the context of their tool or from their vantage point, not that of their customer. I’ve quite literally heard sales engineers open with “So what are the features or capabilities of our tool that you’d like to see?” NO! “Which of our use cases do you think you fit into?” NO! “Which of our tools would you like me to show you?” NO! NO! NO! This is not technical discovery.

**Tags:** orange


INSIGHT: I’ve used the terms “features and functions” a number of times in this chapter. Allow me to say that when it comes time to preparing for the demo – which is Habit #3, covered in depth in the next chapter – we are NOT going to do a “features and functions” demo. We are going to create a script for the demo and tell a story. We will weave the key features and functions that we want to demonstrate into that story. So please do not be alarmed by the fact that I’m using the words features and functions here. At this point in the process, it is important to identify the specific things that we need to demonstrate.

**Tags:** orange


Habit #3 is to PREPARE for demonstrations with both effectiveness, and efficiency in mind.

**Tags:** orange


Demo content is WHAT we are going to show. The demo script is what we are going to SAY, how we are going to say it, and the order in which we are going to say it.

**Tags:** orange


There are three mistakes that we see most often in the field:   We UNDERPREPARE (or we don’t prepare at all) We OVERPREPARE – which wastes time and sets us up for problems during the demo We focus too much on CONTENT and too little on SCRIPT

**Tags:** orange


Here’s what you need to do to build your plan: Develop a demo content plan Develop a demo script outline Collaborate/negotiate with your sales counterpart Commit to the plan Schedule the demo

**Tags:** orange


Before jumping into ‘build mode,’ go back to the notes from the Technical Discovery Call to determine the following: Custom Data – do you need to build out custom data to drive certain behavior, or to produce required views or reports? Business Context – does the industry example or business scenario matter to your audience or will the standard demo context suffice? Look and Feel Customization – will a customized appearance – logos, color schemes, etc. – be required? Capability Gaps, Shortcomings – were there requirements that will require some level of development to address? Think the “3 C’s” - configuration, customization, coding

**Tags:** orange


a good rule of thumb, the planned demonstration script should require no more than half the amount of time allotted for the demo. For example, if you are being given 30 minutes to demonstrate. Your script should take no more than 15 minutes to complete – if that.

**Tags:** orange


As such, demos should follow the rule of the capital “T.” Go broad enough to cover all the requirements, but only “ankle deep.”

**Tags:** orange


To summarize, here is a list of the best practices in the context of building the script or story:   The script is the plan for what you are going to say, when, and in what order Your demo should tell a story It should be based on the outcome your customer is trying to achieve It must highlight the solution your product provides It must be backed by specific capabilities that make it possible It should highlight the features that make your solution unique Know your ‘ah-ha’ moments – there should be 3-5 compelling moments in every demo Remember, technical presales is not training  (You are not teaching how to use the tool.) Show that you understand their objective and give them the solution to get them there

**Tags:** orange


Here is a sample outline that lays out a series of storytelling best practices. Use this as a guide when you are building your demo script.   Establish the problem statement What is the current harsh reality? Why is this bad? Identify the symptoms Empathize Give hope Describe the “utopian solution” Give them a vision for the future Address symptoms specifically Demonstrate the vision Lead with the result – what does that utopia look like? Show them the “magic behind the curtain” Give them the taste of success, happiness, and freedom

**Tags:** orange


Action plan to develop this habit:   Build demo content plan and demo script outline based on what you heard during technical discovery Strike a balance between the two Negotiate enough time to prepare Do so diligently and efficiently Be sure to leave time to work on the demo story Avoid preparing more than you can show in the time you have Aim to fill 50% of your allotted time with demo content Remember the rule of the Capital T Avoid the iceberg affect Remember, often times, Less is More

**Tags:** orange


The fourth habit of highly effective sales engineers is to PRACTICE before the demo – to make sure that everything is set up and running correctly.

**Tags:** orange


In summary, practice your demos. Click every click – the important ones. Spot check. Leave NOTHING to chance. The one thing we don’t want after a click is a SURPRISE.

**Tags:** orange


The most effective SEs recognize a demonstration as a performance. We are on stage, and it’s our job to get our prospects excited about our solution.

**Tags:** orange


Before you begin a demonstration, you want to get agreement on the objectives they’re trying to address, the requirements they’re trying to satisfy, the issues they’re trying to solve, etc.

**Tags:** orange


A Confused Mind Always Says NO

**Tags:** orange


To summarize how to handle questions here is the list of rules we covered.   Go into every demo expecting questions – looking for questions No question is a bad question – they offer insights Pay attention to the context of the question – look for hidden agendas Acknowledge the question Acknowledge the person – by name Do so judiciously Repeat the question Assess the person asking the question – key player or non-key player Assess the question itself – on-topic or off-topic Respond accordingly – Dismiss, Defer, Discover, Direct Attention

**Tags:** orange


PARTNER with your sales counterpart. You are in sales, and Sales is a Team Sport.   PROBE into any request for a demonstration. Master the Technical Discovery Call.   PREPARE with the demo in mind. Balance Demo Content with Demo Script.   PRACTICE by Clicking Every Click of significance. Avoid surprises on the other side.   PERFORM when you take the stage. Follow the best practices to get the Technical Win.   PERFECT your demo by applying the principle of Constant and Consistent Improvement.
