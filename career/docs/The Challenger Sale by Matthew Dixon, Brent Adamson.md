# The Challenger Sale by Matthew Dixon, Brent Adamson

Surveys of customers consistently show that they put the highest value on salespeople who make them think, who bring new ideas, who find creative and innovative ways to help the customer’s business. In

An effective sales force is a more sustainable competitive advantage than a great product stream.

**Tags:** orange


Solution selling comes in many flavors, but generally describes the migration from a focus on transactional sales of individual products (usually based on price or volume) to a focus on broad-based consultative sales of “bundles” of products and services.

**Tags:** orange


The best solutions, therefore, are not just unique, but sustainably so, allowing a supplier to address customer challenges in either new or more economical ways relative to the competition.

**Tags:** orange


By definition, a shift to solution selling results in customers’ expecting you to actually “solve” a real problem and not just supply a reliable product.

**Tags:** orange


Our research indicates that widespread support for a supplier across their team is the number-one thing senior decision makers look for in making a purchase decision (a

Second, as deals have become more complex and more expensive, most customers have become much more concerned about whether they’ll ever see a return on their investment.

**Tags:** orange


Suppliers looking to grow a solutions business, then, are going to have to run right at risk, building it directly into their value proposition, as an increasingly large number of customers are no longer willing to accept at face value that “solutions” will ultimately deliver the kind of value that suppliers promise up front.

Figure 2.1. The Five Sales Rep Profiles

**Tags:** orange


Challengers are the debaters on the team. They’ve got a deep understanding of the customer’s business and use that understanding to push the customer’s thinking and teach them something new about how their company can compete more effectively.

**Tags:** orange


Challengers are assertive—they tend to “press” customers a little—both on their thinking and around things like pricing.

**Tags:** orange


While there may be five ways to be average, there’s clearly a dominant way to be a star. And that, by far, is the Challenger profile, comprising nearly 40 percent

**Tags:** orange


You’ll remember that the Challenger rep is the rep who loves to debate.

**Tags:** orange


Offers the customer unique perspectives Has strong two-way communication skills Knows the individual customer’s value drivers Can identify economic drivers of the customer’s business Is comfortable discussing money Can pressure the customer

**Tags:** orange


A Challenger is really defined by the ability to do three things: teach, tailor, and take control:

**Tags:** orange


With their unique perspective on the customer’s business and their ability to engage in robust two-way dialogue, Challengers are able to teach for differentiation during the sales interaction.

**Tags:** orange


Because Challengers possess a superior sense of a customer’s economic and value drivers, they are able to tailor for resonance, delivering the right message to the right person within the customer organization.

**Tags:** orange


Finally, Challengers are comfortable discussing money and can, when needed, press the customer a bit. In this way, the Challenger takes control of the sale.

**Tags:** orange


Figure 2.3. Challenger Versus Relationship Builder Profile

**Tags:** orange


While the Challenger is focused on customer value, the Relationship Builder is more concerned with customer convenience. The Challenger rep wins by maintaining a certain amount of constructive tension across the sale.

In complex sales, Challengers absolutely dominate, with more than 50 percent of all star performers falling into this category.

**Tags:** orange


struggle with the migration to solutions. The world of solution selling is almost definitionally about a disruptive sale. It’s not that you’re asking customers to buy your product and put it up on the shelf with all of the other products they’ve bought. Rather, you’re asking customers to change their behavior—to stop acting in one way and starting acting in another. To make that happen, however, you have to get customers to think differently about how they operate. You need to show them a new way to think about their business. From that perspective, it’s really no surprise that in this more complex world only one profile wins—and it wins by a country mile.

**Tags:** orange


If sales success is more a matter of call volume than call quality, Hard Workers are primed to succeed. Challengers are critical in the complex world of solution selling, but they’re not requisite for every part of the business.

**Tags:** orange


The overall conclusion from our research is this: If you’re on the journey to more of a value-based or solutions-oriented sales approach, then your ability to challenge customers is absolutely vital for your success going forward.

**Tags:** orange


A CHALLENGER IS defined by the ability to do three things—teach, tailor, and take control—and to do all of this through the use of constructive tension.

**Tags:** orange


If you teach without tailoring, you come off as irrelevant. If you tailor but don’t teach, you risk sounding like every other supplier. If you take control but offer no value, you risk being simply annoying.

**Tags:** orange


Individual elements of the model, when invested in, can deliver performance improvements over the status quo, but for the model to really work, all elements must be invested in and developed.

**Tags:** orange


one-size-fits-all teaching message is unlikely to be tenable for most suppliers, aside from those who sell in a single line of business to a highly homogeneous set of customers.

**Tags:** orange


The Challenger model, in other words, isn’t a bolt-on software update—it’s a new operating system for the commercial organization.

**Tags:** orange


The thing that really sets Challenger reps apart is their ability to teach customers something new and valuable about how to compete in their market.

**Tags:** orange


Teaching is all about offering customers unique perspectives on their business and communicating those perspectives with passion and precision in a way that draws the customer into the conversation. These new perspectives apply not to your products and solutions, but to how the customer can compete more effectively in their market. It’s insight they can use to free up operating expenses, penetrate new markets, or reduce risk.

**Tags:** orange


Tailoring relies on the rep’s knowledge of the specific business priorities of whomever he or she is talking to—the specific outcomes that particular person values most, the results they’re on the hook to deliver for their company, and the various economic drivers most likely to affect those outcomes.

**Tags:** orange


The final characteristic that sets Challenger reps apart is their ability to assert and maintain control over the sale. Now, before we go any further, it’s important to note that being assertive does not mean being aggressive or, worse still, annoying or abusive. This is all about the reps’ willingness and ability to stand their ground when the customer pushes back.


The Challenger rep doesn’t give in to the request for a 10 percent discount, but brings the conversation back to the overall solution—pushing for agreement on value, rather than price.

**Tags:** orange


Second, Challengers are also able to challenge customers’ thinking and pressure the customer’s decision-making cycle—both to reach a decision more quickly as well as to overcome that “indecision inertia” that can cause deals to stall indefinitely.

**Tags:** orange


Just as you can’t be an effective teacher if you’re not going to push your students, you can’t be an effective Challenger if you’re not going to push your customers.

**Tags:** orange


“In practice, asserting control can take many forms. In essence, it means that the sales professional takes the lead in the customer discussion with a specific end in mind.”

**Tags:** orange


“When the topic of price comes up, a powerful technique is for the sales professional to shift the discussion from price to value.

**Tags:** orange


In a world where the customer’s status quo is really your worst enemy, and customers are so increasingly risk-averse, the ability to take control can be a game-changer for your sales reps.

**Tags:** orange


this approach is based on a deeply flawed assumption: that customers actually know what they need in the first place.

**Tags:** orange


When you get down to it, Challengers aren’t so much world-class investigators as they are world-class teachers.

**Tags:** orange


They win not by understanding their customers’ world as well as the customers know it themselves, but by actually knowing their customers’ world better than their customers know it themselves, teaching them what they don’t know but should.

On the other hand, those same customers told us that other reps would take the time to provide information so interesting and valuable that—in the words of Neil Rackham—the customer would have been willing to pay for the conversation itself.

**Tags:** orange


Loyalty isn’t won in product development centers, in advertisements, or on toll-free help lines: Loyalty is won out in the field, in the trenches, during the sales call. It’s the result of the conversations our reps are having with customers every single day.

Rep offers unique and valuable perspectives on the market. Rep helps me navigate alternatives. Rep provides ongoing advice or consultation. Rep helps me avoid potential land mines. Rep educates me on new issues and outcomes. Each of these attributes speaks directly to an urgent need of the customer not to buy something, but to learn something.

**Tags:** orange


They’re looking to suppliers to help them identify new opportunities to cut costs, increase revenue, penetrate new markets, and mitigate risk in ways they themselves have not yet recognized.

**Note:** Really like this point

**Tags:** orange


Instead, what sets the best suppliers apart is not the quality of their products, but the value of their insight—new ideas to help customers either make money or save money in ways they didn’t even know were possible.

**Tags:** orange


The best companies don’t win through the quality of the products they sell, but through the quality of the insight they deliver as part of the sale itself.

**Tags:** orange


But what I really need is a rep who knows my needs better than I do—one who can challenge me to think differently about my business altogether. And to do that, great questions aren’t enough. You’ve got to have great insights.

**Tags:** orange


So where does that leave us? In this world—where quality insight trumps all else—it’s no wonder, then, that Challengers win.

**Tags:** orange


Commercial Teaching has four key rules: Lead to your unique strengths. Challenge customers’ assumptions. Catalyze action. Scale across customers.

**Tags:** orange


Commercial Teaching Rule #1: Lead to Your Unique Strengths

**Tags:** orange


First and foremost, commercial teaching must tie directly back to some capability where you outperform your competitors.

**Tags:** orange


the business. We often put it like this: The sweet spot of customer loyalty is outperforming your competitors on those things you’ve taught your customers are important.

**Tags:** orange


Second, and this is the big caveat, in order to ensure that your teaching efforts ultimately lead to your unique strengths, you actually have to know what your unique strengths are.

**Tags:** orange


then, that reps continually revert to price. It’s not just that they struggle to articulate the value of their solution; they struggle to articulate the unique value of their solution.

**Tags:** orange


“Why should our customers buy from us over anyone else?” That’s it. It’s disarmingly simple. But that one question can take your entire commercial leadership team to a very dark place as you realize it’s much harder to answer than you might have thought. In fact, most companies can’t answer it, at least not in a way that’s compelling to customers (again, being “innovative,” “customer-focused,” and “solutions-oriented” doesn’t count).

**Tags:** favorite, orange


If the first rule of Commercial Teaching is all about the connection between insight and supplier, the second is about the connection between insight and customer.

**Tags:** orange


What data, information, or insight can you put in front of your customer that reframes the way they think about their business—how they operate or even how they compete?

**Tags:** favorite, orange


Ironically, if your customer reacts to your sales pitch with something like, “Yes, I totally agree! That’s exactly what’s keeping me up at night!” well, then you’ve actually failed. That may feel counterintuitive, but it’s true nonetheless. Sure, you’ve found an issue or insight that resonates, but it doesn’t reframe.

**Tags:** orange


Rapport and reframe are not the same thing. Just because you “get” the customer’s business doesn’t mean you automatically get the customer’s business. Not by a long shot.

**Tags:** orange


The best indicator of a successful reframe, in other words, isn’t excited agreement but thoughtful reflection.

**Tags:** orange


Still, just because we’ve helped them see things differently doesn’t mean we’ve necessarily persuaded them to do things differently.

**Tags:** orange


So if you want them to take action, you’ll need to build a compelling business case for why action matters in the first place.

**Tags:** orange


If you’re going to build an ROI calculator, make sure it calculates the return on pursuing the reframe, not purchasing your products.

**Tags:** orange


Commercial Teaching Rule #4: Scale Across Customers

**Tags:** orange


But imagine if you could provide those same reps with a manageably small set of well-scripted insights along with two or three easy-to-remember diagnostic questions designed to map the right insight to the right customer.

**Tags:** orange


The one thing every company that’s gone down this path has discovered is this: Needs analysis is not something you can afford to leave in the hands of your individual reps. If your reps’ primary goal going into a sales call is to “discover” the customer’s needs, you’ve lost the battle before you’ve even begun to fight, because, frankly, your customers don’t want to have that conversation.

**Tags:** orange


Commercial Teaching must lead to your unique strengths, challenge customers’ assumptions, catalyze action, and scale across customers.

**Tags:** orange


more than anything else customers are looking to suppliers to challenge their thinking and teach them something they don’t know.

**Tags:** orange


Ultimately, the goal is to take customers on a roller-coaster ride, leading first to a rather dark place before showing them the light at the end of the tunnel. And that light, of course, is your solution.

**Tags:** orange


No one ever sold anything off a spreadsheet alone.

**Tags:** orange


After initial formalities (e.g., introductions, time check, agenda setting), a well-designed teaching pitch starts off with your assessment of your customer’s key challenges.

**Tags:** orange


Rather than asking, “What’s keeping you up at night?” you lay out what you’re seeing and hearing as key challenges at similar companies.

**Tags:** orange


“We’ve worked with a number of companies similar to yours, and we’ve found that these three challenges come up again and again as by far the most troubling. Is that what you’re seeing too, or would you add something else to the list?”

**Tags:** orange


Rather than leading with open-ended questions about customers’ needs, you lead with hypotheses of customers’ needs, informed by your own experience and research.

**Tags:** orange


Building off the challenges your customer just acknowledged in step 1, you now introduce a new perspective that connects those challenges to either a bigger problem or a bigger opportunity than they ever realized they had.

**Tags:** orange


Rather, the Reframe is simply about the insight itself. It’s just the headline. And like any good headline, your goal is to catch your customer off guard with an unexpected viewpoint—to surprise them, make them curious, and get them wanting to hear more.

**Tags:** orange


If your customer’s first reaction to your insight is enthusiastic agreement, then you haven’t actually taught them anything.

**Tags:** orange


This is not the place to be timid, as the entire approach rests on your ability to surprise your customer and make them curious for more information.

**Tags:** orange


Rational Drowning is where you lay out the business case for why the Reframe in step 2 is worth your customer’s time and attention.

**Tags:** orange


Rational Drowning is the numbers-driven rationale for why your customer should think differently about their business, but presented specifically in a way designed to make them squirm a little bit—to feel like they’re drowning.

**Tags:** orange


If your presentation is done well, the customer reaction in step 3 should be something like, “Wow, I had no idea we were wasting that kind of money!” or “I’d never thought of this as an opportunity before.

**Tags:** orange


If you’re going to put an ROI calculator in front of your customer, this is where it goes. But just remember the ROI that you’re calculating. In a world-class teaching pitch a good ROI calculator calculates the ROI on solving the challenge you’ve just taught your customer they have, not the ROI on buying your solution.

**Tags:** orange


Before you demonstrate how your solution can economically solve a key customer challenge, you’ve got to convince the customer that that challenge is worth solving in the first place.

**Tags:** orange


Emotional Impact is all about making absolutely sure that the customer sees themselves in the story you’re telling.

**Tags:** orange


It’s not that they don’t believe your story, it’s just that they don’t see it as their story. You need to get them to internalize what you’re telling them.

**Tags:** orange


As the name implies, Emotional Impact isn’t about the numbers; it’s about the narrative. You’ve got to paint a picture of how other companies just like the customer’s went down a similarly painful path by engaging in behavior that the customer will immediately recognize as typical of their own company. The story, therefore, starts out with something like, “I understand you’re a little bit different, but let me give you a sense of how we’ve

**Tags:** orange


If your customer still thinks they’re different after step 4, you either have the wrong customer or the wrong story.

**Tags:** orange


Coming into step 5 you’ve convinced the customer of the problem. Now you’ve got to convince them of the solution.

**Tags:** orange


This is a point-by-point review of the specific capabilities they would need to have in order to make good on whatever opportunity to make money, save money, or mitigate risk that you’ve just convinced them they’re facing.

**Tags:** orange


If step 5 is about getting customers bought in to acting differently, the goal of step 6 is to demonstrate how your solution is better able than anyone else’s to equip them to act differently.

**Tags:** orange


In the teaching world, the pitch isn’t about the supplier at all. It’s about the customer.

**Tags:** orange


the best sales conversations present the customer with a compelling story about their business first, teach them something new, and then lead to their differentiators.

**Tags:** orange


By placing your unique strengths in context at the end of a highly credible teaching pitch you completely change the customer’s disposition toward your offering.

**Tags:** orange


But beware: By focusing solely on the known value of your offering, you forgo an opportunity to challenge customers’ thinking, which they value even more than whatever you’re selling.

**Tags:** orange


By helping customers think differently about their company, you ultimately want them to think differently about your company.

**Tags:** orange


Once you’ve established clarity around step 6—Your Solution—your next stop in building a powerful Commercial Teaching conversation is step 2—the Reframe. You need to identify the core insight, or ah-ha! moment, that will get your customer to say, “Wow, I never thought about it that way before.”

**Tags:** orange


“What’s currently costing our customers more money than they realize, that only we can help them fix?”

**Tags:** orange


Much of that work has been done inside the organization through better segmentation and customer analysis, significantly reducing the burden on the one skill reps probably struggle with the most.

**Tags:** orange


Second, the conversation is prescripted. A teaching rep still has to interact with the customer in a live setting, answering questions and adapting to unanticipated objections. However, the rep’s opening set of hypotheses is already laid out in detail, and every step along the way is clearly marked through the teaching choreography.

**Tags:** orange


Finally, the solution the rep is working toward is predefined. The burden on the rep to determine the right solution for an individual customer is significantly reduced, as the solution is largely determined in advance through organizational identification of the supplier’s unique benefits and needs-based segmentation of customers.

**Tags:** orange


Identify your unique benefits. Develop commercial insight that challenges customers’ thinking. Package commercial insight in compelling messages that “lead to.” Equip reps to challenge customers.

**Tags:** orange


marketing must serve as the “insight generation machine” that keeps reps well equipped with quality teaching material that customers will find compelling.

**Tags:** orange


Sales, on the other hand, will have to ensure that reps have the knowledge, skills, and coaching necessary to go out and use that insight in a convincing manner to actually challenge customers.

**Tags:** orange


“A successful teaching pitch must do four things well. First, it must be big. Done well, it will be seen by the customer as more expansive and farther-reaching than an ordinary idea. Second, it must be innovative. It has to push the envelope with new, often untested and unique approaches. Third, it must be risky. Big ideas mean that we are asking our own companies and our customers to take a big risk in adopting our idea. And lastly, it must be difficult. The idea itself must be hard to do—either because of scale, uncertainty, or politics—otherwise, why would a customer hire you to fix it for them?”

**Tags:** orange


actually a pretty tough place to be. It’s hard to drive organic growth and deepen customer relationships when your customers think of you by and large as a transactional supplier of relatively unimportant products.

**Tags:** orange


They needed to build a convincing story, not about how Grainger can sell you more hammers, but about how it can help you improve your bottom line by saving you money.

**Tags:** orange


The real problem wasn’t so much that customers failed to think about Grainger strategically, but that they failed to think of their own MRO spend strategically. It’s hard to be perceived as an important partner when your customers think of you as only touching an unimportant part of the business.

**Tags:** orange


while, it really took us to a dark place. After all, what were we better at than anyone else? Were we really any different?” It’s a difficult question for most companies. When you sit down to really define the specific set of capabilities that sets you apart, once you cross off “innovative,” “customer-focused,” “solutions-oriented,” “market leader,” “great people,” “trusted,” and “rich history” from your list, many executives land in the same dark place Grainger did. And now you’ve got to roll up your sleeves and set about the hard work of identifying real capabilities that only you can offer. For

**Tags:** orange


Grainger then took those insights and built them into a conversation titled “The Power of Planning the Unplanned,” a world-class example of a Commercial Teaching conversation. This is the kind of content organizations need to provide the frontline sales force in order to make Commercial Teaching work beyond

**Tags:** orange


That’s how the conversation is set up from the very beginning—as a conversation about the customer’s MRO spend, not about Grainger’s capabilities.

**Tags:** orange


So as you might imagine, the Grainger sales rep requests the meeting in the first place in order to share some important insights Grainger has learned about how most companies could save a lot of money simply by thinking differently about how they manage their MRO spend.

**Tags:** orange


In fact, take a look at the agenda for the sales call:

**Tags:** orange


Remember, customers want to talk about their business, not your solution, and that’s exactly how Grainger positions the meeting.

**Tags:** orange


stop, step 1, the Warmer: The Warmer starts with the customer’s challenges. So the opening is, “We know you face a host of challenges every day, such as production line issues, workers’ comp costs, maintenance and safety issues. Especially those challenges that are critical to keeping your business open and running every single day.”

**Tags:** orange


Grainger has found that this one page can lead to an incredibly robust and valuable conversation—all because the rep led with a hypothesis of customer need rather than an open-ended question to “discover” customer need.

**Tags:** orange


That happens in step 2, the Reframe. To change the way customers think about their MRO spend, Grainger starts by breaking that spend into its typical categories: tools, safety, lighting, janitorial, and so on.

**Tags:** orange


from what they buy to how they buy.

**Note:** What the use to schedule vs how they think about scheduling
- optimized schedules = higher throughput, higher utilization , and less waste

**Tags:** orange


To ensure that the customer truly sees themselves in the story Grainger is telling, Grainger uses a slide they like to call the “Pain Chain” to illustrate how nearly every company acts when something important breaks down that they need to replace in a hurry.

**Tags:** orange


“That’s great, but I’ve got another guy that says he can do just the part I need right now for a lot less. I’d like to work with you guys, but only if you throw all this other stuff out and knock 30 percent off the price of what’s left.” Painful.

**Note:** Good example of batched/siteline prospect who only needs one aspect of those systems

**Tags:** orange


The first was to build a better story. While the company had a clear understanding of the unique benefits that set their solution apart, they needed messaging leading to those benefits, rather than with them.

**Tags:** orange


Dealers love the seminars because they deliver exactly what’s advertised: actionable, valuable insight that they can immediately employ to save money, including a set of specific signs to watch out for to tell when money is being wasted in their organization.

**Tags:** orange


The single biggest incremental opportunity to drive growth isn’t in the products and services you sell, but in the quality of the insight you deliver as part of the sale itself.

**Tags:** favorite, orange


Yes, the recent financial crisis and economic downturn exacerbated customer risk aversion, but the increase in consensus requirements is a trend we were tracking long before the downturn.

**Tags:** orange


Decision makers think of themselves as buying from organizations, not from individuals.

**Tags:** orange


Figure 6.1. Sales Experience Drivers of Customer Loyalty for Decision Makers (Indexed)

**Tags:** orange


Of all the things that decision makers care about, topping the list in figure 6.1 is “widespread support for the supplier across my organization.” One way to think of that is that senior decision makers simply aren’t willing to go out on a limb for a supplier on a big purchase—at least not on their own.

**Tags:** orange


At the same time, we found that decision makers don’t want you to waste their time, either. They want suppliers to be accessible, easy to buy from, and willing to collaborate with other suppliers when necessary.

**Tags:** orange


maker isn’t directly through that door at all. It turns out it’s an indirect path that a rep needs to take to earn that decision maker’s support, one that lays the groundwork with the customer’s team—identifying, nurturing, and encouraging key customer stakeholders across the organization.

**Tags:** orange


First, when we isolate influencers and end users from the larger sample, and compare the impact on their loyalty of the overall sales experience versus that of the individual rep, what we find is that—unlike decision makers—these influencers place much more emphasis on the individual rep selling to them. End users don’t think of themselves as buying from organizations; they buy from people.

**Tags:** orange


Figure 6.2. Drivers of Sales Representative Loyalty for Influencers and End Users (Indexed)

**Tags:** orange


But the bigger story lies in the next set of drivers we found, right behind professionalism in their predictive power: the ability of the rep to “offer unique and valuable perspectives” and “frequently educate the customer on issues and outcomes.”

**Tags:** orange


What the data tells us is that for non–decision makers, loyalty is much less about discovering needs they already know, and much more about teaching them something they don’t know, for example, something new about how to compete more effectively in their world.

**Tags:** orange


Figure 6.3. Purchase Experience Loyalty Drivers for Decision Makers Versus End Users and Influencers

**Tags:** orange


The best way you sell more stuff over time isn’t by going directly to the person who signs the deal, but by approaching him or her indirectly through stakeholders able to establish more widespread support for your solution.

**Tags:** orange


Figure 6.4. The New Physics of Sales

**Tags:** orange


And we have found that one of the biggest obstacles that core reps grapple with when it comes to dealing with a consensus-based buying environment is how to tailor the sales message to these different stakeholders in order to achieve maximum resonance.

**Tags:** orange


Figure 6.5. Layers of Tailoring

**Tags:** orange


Challenger reps aren’t focused on what they are selling, but on what the person they’re speaking to is trying to accomplish.

**Tags:** orange


Customer outcomes are what an individual at the customer organization is trying to achieve—how they would define success as part of their job.

**Tags:** orange


The example functional bias card in figure 6.6 is for a head of manufacturing. On these functional bias cards, you find things like the high-level decision criteria (or business outcomes) that a person in this role cares most about.

**Tags:** orange


Figure 6.7. Desired Outcomes and Supplier Capabilities Mapped to Functional Roles

**Tags:** orange


What you see in figure 6.7 is a hypothetical tailoring tool for Solae’s “Solution A” (some of the information is disguised here, given its proprietary nature). Solae uses the tool to show reps the various customer stakeholders who are relevant for Solution A, as well as the high-level outcomes most important to each of those individuals.

**Tags:** orange


Once a deal has progressed far enough along the sales process, and the Solae account team has developed a project proposal for customer review, their reps use a template similar to the one you see in figure 6.8 to both win and document customer buy-in to the project.

**Tags:** orange


The template captures the agreed-upon high-level project objective—laid out specifically in terms of what the customer gets and the major stakeholders across whom Solae needs to build consensus.

**Tags:** orange


The most impressive thing about this approach is that all of this is mapped out with the customer. This information is determined through conversations and then captured using the tool. Though it’s not required, Solae’s very best reps actually ask that stakeholder to sign off on the column indicating their agreement with the plan.

**Tags:** orange


That way each stakeholder is agreeing, in advance, to the value you’re going to create for them as an individual and how that value is going to be measured across the life of the deal. As a result, when it comes time for this person to decide whether or not they’re going to support the deal, they’re not making that decision based on some vague sense of whether the deal is “good for the company.”

**Tags:** orange


In fact, even if you use it only for internal purposes, this tool still represents an essential and yet typically missing page in any good account plan: a concrete, concise summary of how you’re going to deliver your solution in a way that doesn’t just meet overall expectations, but individual ones as well.

**Tags:** orange


According to the data, this ability comes from two things: Challenger reps are naturally more comfortable talking about money, and they’re able to “push” the customer. What we’re really talking about here is the Challenger’s ability to demonstrate and hold firm on value and the ability to maintain momentum across the sales process. Challengers are comfortable discussing money because they are confident in the value they will provide to the customer.

**Tags:** orange


Remember, the value that the Challenger provides is built on the Commercial Teaching message.

**Tags:** orange


It’s confidence built on the knowledge that you’ve taught the customer about a problem they didn’t previously know they had. There’s now a burning platform—one you created—and it just so happens that you sell the only solution to that problem.

**Tags:** orange


When Relationship Builders come to the end of a customer meeting, they won’t push hard on next steps for fear of ruining what was otherwise a positive interaction. But Challengers understand that the goal is to sell a deal, not just have a good meeting; they are focused on moving ahead.

**Tags:** orange


One of the biggest misconceptions about taking control is that it’s about negotiation skills. But our research shows that Challegers take control across the entirety of the sales process, not just at the end.

**Tags:** orange


When these contacts don’t grant the access Challenger reps know will be critical to completing the sale, their response is to cut the sales effort short and move on to the next opportunity.

**Tags:** orange


They tell their reps that an early litmus test of how serious a given customer is about partnering is whether they will agree to grant the supplier’s sales rep access to key stakeholders.

**Tags:** orange


Their reps are taught, at the close of the first interaction, to say, “You know, typically when we engage with a customer for this sort of solution, we need certain key executives to be involved in the purchase decision. Is that the case here?”

**Tags:** orange


“In my own research, I saw some reps losing more customers to cheaper suppliers late in the sale because they failed to take control early on. They steered clear of having a tough conversation about the commercial side of the interaction, fearing it would damage the relationship. Other reps, however, confronted the customer early in the sale, saying, ‘It’s going to cost us $200K to put our best thinking into your problem. We’re willing to do it, but we need some assurance that if we invest in you, you’ll invest in us.’ These reps had far fewer customers switch to cheaper suppliers late in the sales process.”

Challengers, by contrast, “lead and simplify.” Rather than assuming that the customer knows how to execute the purchase of a complex solution—which can be a faulty assumption when it comes to solution selling—they teach the customer how to buy the solution.

Instead of asking, “Who needs to be involved?” Challenger reps coach the customer on who should be involved.

Sounds familiar, doesn’t it? The Commercial Teaching approach, as you recall, is about getting away from the “What’s keeping you up at night?” question and instead bringing unique insight to the customer about what should be keeping them up at night.

What’s more, a Challenger knows that the average sales rep will seek to take control only at the end of the sale—at the negotiating table—and so Challengers differentiate themselves by taking control from the start. Customers value this because they see the Challenger as a confident partner in the sales process, not a nervous rep crossing their fingers in the hope of making a sale.

but more important, they push the customer in terms of how they think about their world and their challenges—as well as the solution to those challenges.

Why is it important to take control around ideas? Because it’s extremely unlikely that a customer—especially a seasoned executive—is going to roll over and accept the reframe that the Challenger delivers without a healthy does of skepticism. More likely, he’ll push back.

“You’re right, your company surely is different, but so are the other organizations we work with . . . and I can tell you that this insight has helped them to rethink the way they run their operations.

Commercial Teaching puts the Challenger in a position to take control by bringing new ideas to the table—ideas the customer hadn’t thought of before.

If the rep isn’t willing to convince the customer that the problem is urgent, then he won’t be able to convince the customer it’s worth solving.

assertive individuals are much more constructive, using strong language, perhaps, but not so strong that it’s off-putting or offensive. So the rep pushes the customer, but does so with respect and sensitivity to how the customer is reacting.

“Think about it. You are teaching your customers things that they didn’t know before. You have practical experiences from hundreds, if not thousands, of implementations, while this may be the first such implementation for your customer. Taking control means that you know the value of those resources and you don’t bring them to bear willy-nilly on a customer who isn’t serious about the decision. If the customer asks for a case study, or to talk to a reference, a Relationship Builder says, ‘Yes!’ A Challenger says, ‘Sure, but let me ask you if this is the very last confirmation you need before we agree to work together and you sign the paperwork.’ Why? Because the Challenger is confident in the value he and his company bring to the customer.”

The key to DuPont’s approach to equipping reps to take control at the negotiating table is this: You’ve got to have a plan.

It also forces them to play out the next few interactions in the negotiation. Our research shows that one of the biggest differentiators of high-performing reps is the amount of time they spend planning—this is a prime example. Like a great chess player, high performers are focused not just on the current move, but on the scenarios that will play out several moves ahead.

When we ran the analysis, we found that the attributes contributing to manager excellence fall into three high-level categories—and they’re about what you might expect: selling, coaching, and owning.

This last category is all about the various aspects of business ownership that senior leaders like to see in managers—the extent to which they run their territory as if it were their own business.

But more to the point, managers are also expected to be able to model great selling behaviors for their teams.

rose to the top inside that category. Here, we see that the same skills that matter most for manager success are the exact same sales skills we found to matter most for rep success: “Offers the customer unique perspectives,” “Tailors the offer to the needs of customers,” “Is comfortable discussing money.”

Coaching absolutely matters when it comes to sales management. It is a key element of manager effectiveness and, as we have long advocated to our members, a huge driver of rep performance as well.

**Tags:** orange


Unlike selling, however, which is about a manager’s ability to be a rep when needed, coaching is about the manager working side by side with reps to share his knowledge, insight, and experience to diagnose and correct specific rep behaviors known to hinder high performance.

So if “sales leadership” isn’t about resource allocation, what is it about? Well, it turns out that sales leadership is mostly about how innovative sales managers are.

**Tags:** orange


What we’re referring to here is managers collaborating with reps to understand as deeply as possible what’s holding up a deal, figuring out why and where a deal is running into trouble at the customer, and then finding innovative ways to move it forward.

**Tags:** orange


This is about creatively connecting the supplier’s existing capabilities to each customer’s unique environment and then presenting those capabilities to the customer through the specific lens of whatever customer obstacle is keeping that deal from closing.

What this “Sales Innovation” factor tells us is that star-performing managers have an uncanny ability to unstick stuck deals and get them closed.

Coaching is about driving performance around known behaviors. It’s a perfect approach to sales management in a world characterized by a predictable path to success. Innovation, on the other hand, is about driving performance through unforeseen obstacles. It’s best suited to a world of dynamic and unexpected events. In coaching, the manager already knows the answer and imparts it to the rep. In innovation, neither the rep nor the manager knows the answer, so instead they collaborate through the manager’s leadership to discover an effective path forward. You can’t coach what you don’t know, but you can innovate.

At 29 percent, sales innovation is the single biggest sales-related attribute contributing to world-class sales manager performance—more important than selling skills and much more important than a manager’s ability to allocate resources.

But if you’re a core performer, the quality of the coaching you receive has a significant impact on your performance. The data from our research suggests that the median performers on your sales force could see a performance boost of as much as 19 percent given a significant improvement in the coaching they receive.

Some members like to call that “spreadsheet coaching.” It’s focused on business results, not behaviors, and it’s delivered in a one-size-fits-all manner—everybody gets the exact same treatment. But done well, coaching is about behaviors, not outcomes.
