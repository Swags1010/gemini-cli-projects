# The Trusted Advisor by David H. Maister, Charles H. Green, Robert M. Galford

The ultimate example may be Forrester Research’s Zero Trust model for network security. To oversimplify, it suggests that the most trustworthy digital network is one that has zero reliance on personal trust, because personal trust implies risk, and the intent is to eliminate risk.


We then focus on three basic skills that a trusted advisor needs: (1) earning trust; (2) giving advice effectively; and (3) building relationships.


Here is a listing of traits that our trusted advisors have in common. They: Seem to understand us, effortlessly, and like us Are consistent (we can depend on them) Always help us see things from fresh perspectives Don’t try to force things on us (it’s our decision) Help us think things through Don’t substitute their judgment for ours Don’t panic or get overemotional (they stay calm) Help us think and separate our logic from our emotion Criticize and correct us gently Don’t pull their punches (we can rely on them to tell us the truth) Are in it for the long haul (the relationship is more important than the current issue) Give us reasoning (to help us think), not just their conclusions Give us options, increase our understanding of those options, give us their recommendation, and let us choose Challenge our assumptions (help us uncover the false assumptions we’ve been working under) Make us feel comfortable and casual personally (while still taking the issues seriously) Act like real people, not someone in a role Are reliably on our side and always seem to have our best interests at heart Remember what we tell them (without notes) Are always honorable (they don’t gossip about others to us, and we trust their values) Help us put our issues in context, often through the use of metaphors, stories, and anecdotes (few problems are completely unique) Have a sense of humor to diffuse (our) tension in tough situations Are smart (sometimes in ways we’re not)


“the problem is rarely what the client said it was in the first meeting.”


Fig. 2.1 Roles in a Client-Advisor Relationship


The trusted advisor is the person the client turns to when an issue first arises, often in times of great urgency: a crisis, a change, a triumph, or a defeat.

Becoming a trusted advisor at the pinnacle level requires an integration of content expertise with organizational and interpersonal skills. Trust doesn’t just “happen” with the passage of time. Typically it requires a form of personal courage—the will and the skills to raise difficult issues, to communicate empathy and understanding, and the ability to genuinely entertain different and difficult ideas.


Marketing people are fond of pointing out three kinds of professional-client relationships, which correspond to three approaches to winning business. These are product/service-based (also known as as “features and benefits”), needs-based (often characterized as “solutions”), and relationship-based approaches (which tend to emphasize not only affinity with the client, but organizational ease of implementation).


A common trait of all these trusted advisor relationships is that the advisor places a higher value on maintaining and preserving the relationship itself than on the outcomes of the current transaction, financial and otherwise.


Often, the advisor will make a substantial investment in the client (without a guarantee of return) before the relationship does, in fact, generate any income, let alone any profit.


Trusted advisors: Have a predilection to focus on the client, rather than themselves. They have… enough self-confidence to listen without prejudging enough curiosity to inquire without supposing an answer a willingness to see the client as coequal in a joint journey enough inner confidence to subordinate their own ego Focus on the client as an individual, not as a person fulfilling a role. Believe that a continued focus on problem definition and resolution is more important than technical or content mastery. Show a strong “competitive” drive aimed not at competitors, but at constantly finding new ways to be of greater service to the client. Consistently focus on doing the next right thing, rather than on aiming for specific outcomes. Are motivated more by an internalized drive to do the right thing than by their own organization’s rewards or dynamics. View methodologies, models, techniques, and business processes as means to an end. They are useful if they work and are to be discarded if they don’t; the test is effectiveness for this client. Believe that success in client relationships is tied to the accumulation of quality experiences. As a result, they seek out client-contact experiences and take personal risks with clients rather than avoid them. Believe that both selling and serving are aspects of professionalism. Both are about proving to clients that you are dedicated to helping them with their issues. Believe that there is a distinction between a business life and a private life, but that both lives are very personal (i.e., human). They recognize that refined skills in dealing with other people are critical in business and in personal life; the two worlds are often more alike than they are different, and for some, they overlap to an extraordinary extent.


A bad recommendation can destroy someone’s forty years of savings and fiscal responsibility. Good advice can change the trajectory of someone’s life. Money can lead to divorce, suicide—or profound happiness. This is very core-human stuff. It’s hard not to tie up your earnings and your financial net worth with what you are worth as a human being. Telling people what you make is more taboo than talking about politics, religion, and sex.


What all this means is that core trusted advisor concepts are no longer just for traditional advisory roles. Customer experience people need those concepts; so do tech-support people, contracts people—pretty much anyone with important customer interactions.


The core “trusted advisor” model is still valid, but the applications are shifting. For one thing, you can no longer get by with just one such relationship; most C-suite governance models these days require that you have trust-based connections with several key people in the organization that drive change and are important stakeholders in any major initiative.


we must work continuously to convince others that we truly are worthy of their trust.


When retaining a professional, what you (and your clients) want is someone who understands your interests and will not put their interests ahead of yours while working for you.


(Similarly, we urge readers never to advertise themselves as “trusted advisors.” It is wonderful if someone else labels you that way; but to toot your own horn is akin to saying “humility is my best quality.”)


The key point is that trust must be earned and deserved. You must do something to give other people the evidence on which they can base their decision on whether to trust you. You must be willing to give in order to get.


For example, David once had to hire a lawyer to probate a relative’s will. The first few lawyers he spoke with tried to win his business by telling him when their firm was founded, how many offices they had, and how much they would charge. None of this inspired much confidence. In fact, the more they talked about themselves and their firms, the less interested they appeared to be in David and his problems.


The answer the senior partner gave contained quite a different subtext. It said: “I will answer your questions, directly and truthfully, even if it means losing a chance at your business.” In that moment, Charlie learned two important things about building trust. First, it has to do with keeping one’s self-interest in check, and, second, trust can be won or lost very rapidly.


To answer these questions, it helps to note some characteristics of trust. Specifically, it: Grows, rather than just appears Is both rational and emotional Is a two-way relationship Is intrinsically about perceived risk Is different for the client than it is for the advisor Is personal


Yet this is only half the story. While outstanding technical competence (or content) is a nonnegotiable, essential ingredient for success, it is not sufficient. Trust is a lot richer than logic alone, and it is a significant component of success.


The trusted advisor relationship takes place between two individuals and is highly personal.


It involves emotion as well as intellect. It is dynamic and fluid. Building a trusted advisor relationship involves not only straightforward discussion, rigorous decision making, and conventional consultation, but also moments of revelation, late-night inspirations, odd actions of connection, and moments of epiphany.


This characteristic of trust has an interesting implication. Just because you can trust does not mean you can be trusted. However, if you are incapable of trusting, you probably can’t be trusted. The ability to trust someone else is a necessary, though not a sufficient, condition for being trustworthy.


Now, many members of today’s workforce should, but don’t have managers who really are trusted advisors to them, mentoring, guiding, coaching them, not just supervising their work and expecting results. Why are we having to make up words for something we should already be doing as managers of others? You’ve already written them.


But advice giving is almost never an exclusively logical process. Rather, it is almost always an emotional “duet,” played between the advice giver and the client. If you can’t learn to recognize, deal with, and respond to client emotions, you will never be an effective advisor.


It is not enough for a professional to be right: An advisor’s job is to be helpful.


No matter how technical one’s field or discipline, the act of giving advice is crucially dependent on a deep understanding of the personalities involved, and on the ability to adapt the advice-giving process to the specific individuals involved.


To understand some of the emotions surrounding the client’s use of professionals, think of the personal risks (reputation, promotion opportunities, bonuses, perhaps even one’s career) that go along with the responsibility for choosing (and working with) any outside provider for a risky or expensive corporate matter.


What clients frequently want is someone who will take away their worries and absorb all their hassles. Yet all too often, they encounter professionals who add to their worries and create extra headaches, forcing them to confront things they would prefer to ignore. (“Doctor, I came to you about my sore feet, and you are giving me grief about my weight. Can’t you just treat my feet and leave me alone about my weight?”)

Since clients are often anxious and uncertain, they are, above all, looking for someone who will provide reassurance, calm their fears, and inspire confidence.


One of the characteristics of most people is that we don’t like to be told what to do—unless the teller has first shown that they understand and respect us.


“People don’t care what you know until they know that you care.”


This means sequencing is an important issue for advice giving. Acts of understanding and respect should precede the giving of advice.


In practical terms, that is why deep listening is so important to the advisory role. To be heard, first you must listen. To get your advice taken, the client must first believe and feel that you have taken the time to understand their unique situation.


The point is for the client to accept your advice. The client may even have sought you out because you have seen this problem a hundred times. Still, they will not fully accept your advice until they feel that you have understood their unique situation.


“One of the rookie mistakes I made many times during my early days was to jump into the solution as soon as I heard the problem description. Turns out this is not the best way to present a solution.”


in many advisory relationships, the client is untrained in the professional’s specialty, while the professional may have seen the client’s problem (or variants of it) many times before. There is thus an almost constant threat of coming across to the client as patronizing, pompous, and arrogant.


Although advising clients sometimes feels like explaining things to a child, the secret to becoming a good advisor is to do exactly the opposite.


As a quick rule of thumb, it is usually better to try to turn assertions into questions. Instead of saying, “This is the best solution,” try the following: “My other clients usually do X for the following reasons. Do you think that reasoning applies here?”

The principle here is that the successful advisor assumes responsibility for the proper mutual understanding.


In higher-level coaching you never start a question with “Why.” That’s what they’d ask at Toyota if the paint isn’t right when the car comes off the line. “Why is the paint flawed?” is a perfectly rational question to ask about a process. But this isn’t a paint operation. Processes don’t have feelings—but people do. In coaching people, “Why” has a judgmental edge. It moves inquiry from “Why is a thing so?” to “Why did/didn’t you…?” In coaching, as in advisory, you strive for curiosity, not judgment. Curiosity is the door opener to and a sustainer of intimacy. I think advice giving is appropriate for advisors, more than for coaches. But trusted advisor conversations need to be as intimate and personal as coaching conversations. The principle is the same. You’re there to help them make what ultimately must be a personal decision. It may well lead to a business outcome to which an advisor should properly offer suggestions; but there will always be a personal stake, about which you must be curious in order to understand and honor.


The most effective way to influence a client is to help the person feel that the solution was (to a large extent) his or her idea, or at the very least, his or her decision.


A good process for the advisor to follow is: Give them their options Give them an education about the options (including enough discussion for them to consider each option in depth) Give them a recommendation Let them choose


If you can’t deal with client politics, you cannot be an effective advisor.


Building trust also requires reducing ambiguities. It is tempting (and probably true) to think that conflicting agendas, priorities, and goals are the clients’ fault, not yours. However, unless you can develop the approaches and skills necessary to deal with these, your advice will not be acted upon, and you will not be seen as a helpful, useful advisor.


Before you go into any meeting with a client (or prospective client), figure out the two or three things you want the client to absolutely believe about you by the end of the meeting.


“I know that your merger with ABC is still a work in progress. What I would like to learn more about is what you found to be the biggest integration challenges of employees from so many cultures and backgrounds.” or, “I read the speech you gave your trade association on this subject. I’ve reviewed your company’s press releases. What I don’t know is what kinds of options you’re considering that may be too delicate for public consumption…” Such questions demonstrate that you are thorough, that you respect the client’s time enough to be prepared, and that you are ready to get right to the issues.


Accordingly, as you listen to a client talk, the question on your mind should be, “What makes this person different from any other client I’ve served? What does that mean for what I should say and how I should behave?” Unfortunately, this is hard work. The natural tendency for most of us is to do the exact opposite: We listen for the situations we recognize, so that we can draw upon past experience to use the words, approaches, and tools that we already know well. It’s the way most of us work, but it doesn’t always serve us well.


Before you can help someone, you need to understand what’s on their mind. You must create situations where they will tell you more about their issues, concerns, and needs.


What the advice receiver wanted was a combination of a sympathetic ear, emotional support, an understanding of the difficulties faced, and the opportunity to collect his or her own thoughts by talking them through in a nonthreatening environment.


All people, including clients, want affirmation, approval, support, and appreciation. In order to get your client to listen to and accept your advice, you must develop the skills and behavior patterns that ensure that you provide affirmation, support, approval, and appreciation along with your advice.

We all want to hear solutions to our problems, but we are not at all inclined to take them seriously unless the person giving the answers has “earned the right” to give them. Earning the right has three parts: Understanding the client’s situation Understanding how the client feels about it Convincing the client that we understand both of the previous two items


Life would be easier if people always said precisely what they mean, but they don’t: People hint a lot.


Of course, it is not only clients who are ambiguous and hint a lot. Advisors do, too. To be an effective advice giver, you must work at making sure that what you intended to say was actually heard that way.


Great trusted advisors can be relied upon to tell the client the bad news, along with the good. They can be relied upon to tell the truth, always with tact and care.


Demands are usually resented, while requests for help usually evoke a positive response. It is an interesting feature of the human condition that we often resent those who have done us a favor, because we now owe them something in return. In contrast, we feel kindly disposed to those we have helped.


There is no more certain way to make somebody think you are fascinating and enjoyable to be with than to keep them talking about themselves.


If you want to influence someone, you must find out what influences them. The only way to do this is to ask questions, more questions, and even more questions—and to pay attention to the answers.

There is a difference in being polite and being interested, and the difference is transparent to the observer. Simple practices like taking notes and reviewing them before the next meeting can help a lot (we can all testify that this practice grows in importance as you develop more contacts—and get older!). The goal here is not to fake an interest, but to use whatever tools you need to help you show that you really are paying attention.


Look for opportunities to pay a sincere compliment to the other person. Everyone likes and appreciates them, as long as they are rooted in truth. The Italians have an expression for people who behave otherwise. They call them the falsi cortesi (or the fake courteous). Compliments must be specific enough to make clear that they are not mere puffery. “You look nice” has no credibility. “The color of that suit looks great on you” is better. Best is, “I believe you are an effective leader because I hear how people speak about you when you are not there, and I have also observed changes in the way your people do such and so.”


Everyone wants to be appreciated. To state the same thought in reverse, there are few things more destructive to friendship, romance, or trust than the feeling that you are being taken for granted. Naturally, this happens often, in business as in life.


Guard against defaulting to the “lowest emotional bandwidth” form of communication. While digital has undeniably been an enormous benefit to communications (email alone is a Gutenberg-level change), it has become so ubiquitous that it can be tempting to just use email or text when a phone call might be called for.


Exploit the capabilities of a given communications technology: use emojis (if appropriate—communication etiquette is an ever-evolving set of mores) in addition to just text; use the video features of web-meetings, not just the audio; use photos on your webpage, not just biographies; be conscious of the book titles behind you on your webcam.


Compensate for the limitations of a given technology: Use more words in that email, more inflection in your voice on that video or phone call. Pay attention to the lighting in your room before you turn on your webcam.


If you’ve got a multilocation team project with budget for only one in-person meeting, make that meeting at the beginning of the project, not the end; the benefits will accrue through the life of the project.


Do your digital homework. Before a call, look up the other parties online and find out some basic info; download their photos and look at them as you speak with them. Note: You don’t have to refer to this information while on the call—it’s often enough that you simply know the information, because it will subtly inform your interactions with them.


And don’t just make it about yourself. There are digital ways to humanize the relationship by focusing on the other party. Before a call, learn something personal about the other party that goes beyond the usual school connection; look for things that let you say, for example, “I couldn’t help noticing that you [wrote a paper on…], [spent two years in Paris…], [are an amateur meteorologist]” and then link that observation to a legitimate interest of yours. (If there is no link—don’t mention it. If it’s not authentic, it risks being creepy.)


Skills alone will not accomplish the task, however. In addition, a trusted advisor must develop appropriate attitudes or “mindsets.” The most important of these are: Ability to focus on the other person Self-confidence Ego strength Curiosity Inclusive professionalism Principled behavior


To get what you want from someone, you must first focus on giving them what they want!


As Dale Carnegie said, “The only way to influence someone is to find out what they want, and show them how to get it.” Notice that Carnegie did not say “the best way to influence” but “the only way”!


The key is empathetic listening. It’s vital in the pastoral world. It involves the willingness to go to where the other person is, which is usually a very painful place. And you have to be in touch with your own pain to go there. If you don’t know that pain, that terrain, you will not go there. It’s about moving from “I” to “We.”


There is an old saying, “It is amazing what you can achieve if you are not wedded to who gets the credit.”


The key is to focus not on what we know, but on what we don’t know. And that is curiosity: the constant asking of questions. “What’s behind that?” “Why is this the case?” “How does this fit in?”
