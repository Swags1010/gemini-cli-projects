# The Toyota Way by Jeffrey K. Liker

It dawns on the reader that it’s not just the tools and methods that make the Toyota Production System what it is, but the relentless focus on incremental improvement using meaningful gemba walks, structured toolsets or “scientific thinking,” and the role management plays in promoting the desired behaviors that over time get ingrained in the way work is performed.

The Toyota Way can be briefly summarized through the two pillars that support it: “Continuous Improvement” and “Respect for People.” Continuous improvement, often called kaizen, defines Toyota’s basic approach to doing business. Challenge everything. More important than the actual improvements that individuals contribute, the true value of continuous improvement is in creating an atmosphere of continuous learning and an environment that not only accepts, but actually embraces change.

I believe management has no more critical role than to motivate and engage large numbers of people to work together toward a common goal.

**Tags:** orange


We want organizations to be adaptive, flexible, self-renewing, resilient, learning, intelligent—attributes found only in living systems. The tension of our times is that we want our organizations to behave as living systems, but we only know how to treat them as machines.

the Toyota Production System is a total “living system.” The goal is to produce a continual flow of value to the customer, without interruptions known as wastes.

Continuous improvement means getting better every day and is the driver for building a sustainable enterprise. Only those at the gemba can understand the problems fast enough to react quickly. Continuous improvement depends on a different paradigm of the role of the human—all humans are problem detectors and problem correctors—thinking scientifically.

twists. Even in today’s digital age Toyota reveres the craftsworker. I emphasize throughout this book how much Toyota places people at the center of its systems and expects that they spend a lifetime working to perfect their craft. “Use all your senses” is a common Toyota refrain to fully understand what you are working on and how to improve it.

Although Toyota’s manufacturing system looks as if it were deliberately designed as a competitive weapon, it was created gradually through a complex historical process that can never be reduced to managers’ rational foresight alone.

**Tags:** orange


They want people to think. Copying is not thinking or learning. Toyota could try to enforce best practices from headquarters so everyone does things the same way, but then continuous improvement would die. The company would get compliance, not thinking.

The Toyota Production System is represented by a house with the twin pillars of just-in-time and jidoka resting on a foundation of stable, leveled processes. In the center are people continuously improving.

**Tags:** orange


In many ways, TPS methods resemble classical industrial engineering methods, but Toyota turned traditional IE on its head by empowering frontline team members to use the tools to improve their own processes.

**Tags:** orange


We place the highest value on actual implementation and taking action. There are many things one doesn’t understand and therefore, we ask them why don’t you just go ahead and take action; try to do something? You realize how little you know and you face your own failures and you simply can correct those failures and redo it again and at the second trial you realize another mistake or another thing you didn’t like so you can redo it once again. So by constant improvement, or, should I say, the improvement based upon action, one can rise to the higher level of practice and knowledge.

Ultimately, its success derives from its ability to cultivate leadership, teams, and culture; to devise strategy; to build relationships across the value chain; and to maintain a learning organization.

I now realize that throwing out solutions in a public forum is totally contrary to scientific thinking and is no help to the people posing the questions.

**Tags:** orange


In other words, generic “solutions” are simply uninformed guesses,

**Tags:** orange


“fast thinking,” which is fast, automatic, and emotional and feels really good. Jumping to conclusions based on something we thought worked in the past is fast thinking.

**Tags:** orange


Scientific thinking is based on “slow thinking,” which is slow, deliberate, and systematic, and generally speaking we find it arduous, boring, and even painful.

**Tags:** orange


Despite the huge influence of the lean movement, I hope to show that most attempts to implement lean have been superficial. Most companies have focused too heavily on tools such as 5S (cleaning and organizing the place) and work cells, without understanding lean as an entire system that must permeate an organization’s culture. In most companies where lean is implemented, senior management is not involved in the day-to-day operations and continuous improvement efforts that are at the center of lean.

Often, the best thing you can do is to idle a machine and stop producing parts.

**Tags:** orange


Often, it is best to build up an inventory of finished goods in order to level out the production schedule, rather than produce according to the fluctuating demand of customer orders.

**Tags:** orange


Often, it is best to selectively add and substitute overhead for direct labor.

**Tags:** orange


It may not be a top priority to keep your workers busy making parts as fast as possible.

**Tags:** orange


It is best to selectively use automation and information technology and sometimes better to use manual processes even when automation is available and would seem to justify its cost in reducing your headcount.

**Tags:** orange


Often, planning slowly and carefully, then experimenting, then deploying efficiently, is faster than rushing to judgment and implementing immediately.

**Tags:** orange


This is why TPS starts with the customer. Always ask, “What value are we adding from the customer’s perspective?” Because the only thing that adds value in any type of process—be it a manufacturing, service, or development process—is the physical or information transformation of that product, service, or activity into something the customer wants.

**Tags:** orange


Rather the power behind TPS is a company’s management commitment to continuously invest in its people and promote a culture of continuous improvement.

“muda,” or waste, muda being Toyota’s term for anything that takes time but does not add value for your customer.

Practical scientific thinking in this context means taking a fact-based, iterative learning approach to working toward a difficult challenge. Test assumptions!

Sakichi Toyoda’s personal and professional philosophy continues to influence Toyota today through what the company has distilled as his “five main principles”: 1.   Always be faithful to your duties, thereby contributing to the company and to the overall good. 2.   Always be studious and creative, striving to stay ahead of the times. 3.   Always be practical and avoid frivolousness. 4.   Always strive to build a homelike atmosphere at work that is warm and friendly. 5.   Always have respect for spiritual matters and remember to be grateful at all times.

THE SEVEN WASTES: OBSTACLES TO VALUE-ADDED FLOW

**Tags:** orange


Overproduction. Producing ahead of or in anticipation of demand, which generates such wastes as overstaffing and unnecessary storage and transportation costs because of excess inventory.

**Tags:** orange


Waiting (time on hand). Watching or waiting for a machine, waiting for key inputs, or having slack with no immediate deadlines.

**Tags:** orange


Unnecessary transport or conveyance. Carrying work in process (WIP) long distances, creating inefficient transport, or moving materials or information into or out of storage or between processes.

**Tags:** orange


Overprocessing or incorrect processing. Taking unneeded steps to process the parts. Inefficiently processing due to poor tool and product design, causing unnecessary motion and producing defects. Waste is also generated when providing higher-quality products or services than is necessary.

**Tags:** orange


Excess inventory. Excess raw material, WIP, or finished goods causing longer lead times, obsolescence, damaged goods, transportation and storage costs, and delay. Also, extra inventory hides problems such as production imbalances, late deliveries from suppliers, defects, equipment downtime, and long setup times.

**Tags:** orange


Unnecessary movement. Any wasted motion employees perform during their work, such as looking for, walking to, reaching for, or stacking parts, tools, etc.

**Tags:** orange


Defects. Production of defects and correction. Repair or rework, scrap, replacement production, and inspection waste time, effort, and handling.

**Tags:** orange


It may seem counterintuitive, but Ohno considered the fundamental waste to be overproduction, since it causes most of the other wastes. Producing more than the customer wants by any operation in the manufacturing process necessarily causes a buildup of inventory somewhere downstream—which means the material is just sitting around waiting to be processed in the next operation.

**Tags:** orange


You pick a starting point in the value stream, often at the beginning of one large unit, such as the receiving docks in a manufacturing plant, and walk the value stream as the product is transformed—and draw a diagram of the journey.

**Tags:** orange


one of the seven wastes, you may want to reduce inventory. A simple way to do this is to calculate minimum and maximum levels and create a visual with instructions to replenish when you reach the minimum.

**Tags:** orange


As Rother and Shook point out,16 always develop a future state to strive for. Don’t stop at mapping the current state and chasing waste.

**Tags:** orange


The Toyota Production System is a system of people, equipment, and work methods aligned to achieve the objectives of the business. At a general level, these are quality, cost, delivery, safety, and morale.

**Tags:** orange


A better approach is to develop a vision of a system that will achieve the organization’s goals and then systematically strive to achieve that vision through kaizen. Always make the purpose clear.

**Tags:** orange


Value stream mapping is one tool that helps to understand the current state and to develop a high-level vision of how material and information needs to flow to achieve business objectives. This vision provides you a direction to strive toward through relentless PDCA.

First, decisions are made based on observed facts about the issue, rather than on hunches, assumptions, or perceptions. Second, decisions should be put into the hands of those closest to the problem and those who have gone to see it and have a deep understanding of its causes and the possible impact of proposed solutions.

Principle 2  Connect People and Processes Through Continuous Process Flow to Bring Problems to the Surface

**Tags:** orange


The five foundational elements of The Toyota Way 2001 drive continuous improvement in pursuing challenging goals through kaizen and a daily focus on developing people and teams.

**Tags:** orange


Principle 2 Connect People and Processes Through Continuous Process Flow to Bring Problems to the Surface

**Tags:** orange


If some problem occurs in one-piece flow manufacturing then the whole production line stops. In this sense it is a very bad system of manufacturing. But when production stops everyone is forced to solve the problem immediately. So team members have to think, and through thinking team members grow and become better team members and people.

**Tags:** orange


Flow is at the heart of the lean message that shortening the elapsed time from raw materials to finished goods (or services) will lead to the best quality, lowest cost, and shortest delivery time.

**Tags:** orange


Inventory buffers and gaps in time between steps in the process protect downstream processes from upstream processes. If you have a buffer of inventory of a supplier’s parts, you will not be affected by short-term downtime of your supplier or late shipments.

**Tags:** orange


Engineers transform information into a design, so you look at such things as (1) at what points do the engineers make decisions that directly affect the product? and (2) when do the engineers actually conduct important tests or do an analysis that impacts those decisions? Or on the other hand, (3) how much rework is there? Even more complex some of the “rework” is actually useful creative thinking ruling out some ideas that do not prove out.

Principle 3  Use “Pull” Systems to Avoid Overproduction

**Tags:** orange


“Takt” is a German word for rhythm or meter. Takt is the rate of customer demand—the rate at which the customer is buying product.

**Tags:** orange


Takt can be used to set the pace of production and alert workers whenever they are getting ahead or behind.

**Tags:** orange


1.   Builds in quality. It is much easier to build in quality in one-piece flow. Every operator is an inspector and works to fix any problems in his or her station before passing the product to the next station.

**Tags:** orange


2.   Creates real flexibility.

**Tags:** orange


3.   Creates higher productivity. The reason it appears that productivity is highest when your operation is organized by department is because each department is measured by equipment utilization and people utilization.

**Tags:** orange


In a cell, everything is pushed close together, and there is very little space wasted by inventory. By making greater use of the floor space, you can free up space for new products or add new products without expanding the facility.

**Tags:** orange


Smaller batches of material were moved through the factory, which meant getting rid of forklift trucks, a major cause of accidents, and also meant lighter lifting of materials and reduced handling of materials.

**Tags:** orange


7.   Reduces cost of inventory. Capital not tied up in inventory is cash flow that can be invested elsewhere.

**Tags:** orange


An example of fake flow would be moving equipment close together to create what looks like a one-piece flow cell, then batching product at each stage with no sense of customer takt. It looks like a cell, but it works like a batch process.

Figure 2.6 Mast-making operation before and after one-week lean transformation. Description A process improvement diagram compares the manufacturing workflow before and after optimization, showing a reduction in lead time from 3.75 days to 0.80 days. The image illustrates a manufacturing process improvement by comparing the workflow before and after optimization. The “Before” section shows a sequential process with four steps: Saw, Lathe, Drill, and Buff, with a Weld step between Drill and Buff. Each step has associated cycle times (C/T) and work-in-process (WIP) inventory. The total lead time is 3.75 days, with significant delays due to WIP inventory between steps. For example, the Saw step has a C/T of 40 minutes and 0.75 days of WIP inventory, while the Lathe step has a C/T of 104 minutes and 0.25 days of WIP inventory. The Weld step has the longest WIP inventory delay of 1.7 days.The “After” section shows an optimized process where the Saw, Lathe, and Drill steps are combined into one step with a C/T of 105 minutes. The Weld and Buff steps remain separate but are connected by FIFO (first-in, first-out) lanes to control WIP inventory. The WIP inventory is significantly reduced, with the Weld step having 0.13 days of WIP and the Buff step having 0.13 days of WIP. The total lead time is reduced to 0.80 days. The diagram highlights the efficiency gained by combining steps and implementing FIFO lanes to minimize delays.

key to sustainability was continuous improvement.

**Tags:** orange


ONE-PIECE FLOW IS A VISION TO STRUGGLE TOWARD, NOT A TOOL TO IMPLEMENT

**Tags:** orange


Creating flow means linking together processes that otherwise are disjointed. When operations are linked together, there are opportunities for more effective teamwork, rapid feedback on problems, control over the process, and direct pressure for people to solve problems and think and grow.

**Tags:** orange


Toyota is willing to risk shutting down production in order to surface problems and challenge team members to solve them.

**Tags:** orange


While there are immediate benefits of shifting from process islands to a flow line, longer-term benefits come from surfacing problems so they can be addressed quickly, enhancing continuous improvement.

**Tags:** orange


Principle 3 Use “Pull” Systems to Avoid Overproduction

**Tags:** orange


These are examples of pull systems, aka just-in-time (JIT). You receive items only when you demand them, and the retailer receives product based on actual customer demand.

**Tags:** orange


the Toyota Way is not about managing inventory; it is about satisfying customers through lean value streams.

**Tags:** orange


the Toyota Way, “pull” means the ideal state of just-in-time manufacturing: giving the customers (which may be the next step in an internal process) what they want, when they want it, and in the amount they want.

**Tags:** orange


There were four benefits of leveling the schedule: Figure 4.3 Heijunka production (leveled). 1.   Flexibility to make what the customers want when they want it. This reduced the plant’s inventory and its associated problems. 2.   Reduced risk of unsold goods. The plant built only what the customers ordered, reducing the costs of owning and storing obsolete inventory. 3.   Balanced use of labor and machines. The plant could then create standardized work that took into account that some engines required less work and others required more work. Toyota calls this the weighted-average standardized work. As long as a big engine that takes extra work is not followed by another big engine, the workers can handle the big engine, taking a little extra time, and then make up for it on the small engine. Once the plant took this into account and kept the schedule level, it had a balanced and manageable workload over the day with more productive operators. 4.   Smoothed demand on upstream processes and the plant’s suppliers. If the plant uses a just-in-time system for upstream processes and the suppliers deliver multiple times in a day, the suppliers will get a stable and level set of orders. This will allow the suppliers to reduce inventory and then pass some savings on to the customer so that everyone gets the benefits of leveling.


Rule 2 Every customer-supplier connection must be direct, and there must be an unambiguous yes-or-no way to send requests and receive responses.

**Tags:** orange


Sometimes, one-piece flow is not possible because processes are too far apart, cycle times to perform the operations vary a great deal, or there is changeover time.

Figure 3.2 External pull system with suppliers. Description A diagram illustrates a pull-based production system between a supplier plant and a customer plant, using kanban signals for inventory and production management. The diagram depicts a pull-based production system involving a supplier plant and a customer plant, connected through a kanban system. On the left, the supplier plant is shown with a leveled production schedule labeled A through H, representing different production tasks. A worker is assembling a product, and a cart is used to transport new products. Trucks are shown transporting “empties and withdrawal kanban” from the customer plant to the supplier plant and “needed components plus kanban” from the supplier plant to the customer plant. The central concept of “PULL” is emphasized with arrows indicating the flow of materials and information between the two plants. The customer plant on the right is depicted as a factory building, representing the demand-driven nature of the system. The diagram highlights the use of kanban signals to manage inventory and production, ensuring that components are supplied only as needed to meet customer demand.

**Tags:** orange


The traditional way of production scheduling often leads to push systems where even small changes in demand or conditions can throw off the process, leading to inventory banks, parts shortages, and missed shipments.

**Tags:** orange


Toyota uses scheduled systems, often to create leveled schedules, but prefers to schedule only at one point in the factory—the pacemaker.

**Tags:** orange


Ideally, Toyota would only use one-piece flow operations without work-in-process inventory, but for many situations this is not practical.


When one-piece flow is not practical, Toyota pulls parts from small inventory buffers and then replenishes the buffers much like the modern supermarket does.


Kanban (a physical or electronic signal) is often used so the downstream process (customer) can inform the upstream supplier process when it is ready for more of a particular part.


The biggest value of the kanban system is to help visualize the flow, study it, and find ways to reduce inventory in order to get closer to one-piece flow.

Principle 4 Level Out the Workload, Like the Tortoise, Not the Hare (Heijunka)

**Tags:** orange


In general, when you try to apply the TPS, the first thing you have to do is to even out or level the production. And that is the responsibility primarily of production control or production management people. Leveling the production schedule may require some front-loading of shipments or postponing of shipments and you may have to ask some customers to wait for a short period of time.

**Tags:** orange


Muda—non-value added. The most familiar M, muda includes the seven wastes mentioned in earlier chapters. These wasteful activities lengthen lead times, cause extra movement to get parts or tools, create excess inventory, require rework time because of errors, or result in any type of waiting.


Mura—unevenness. In normal production systems, at times there is more work than the people or machines can handle, and at other times there is a lack of work. Unevenness results from an irregular production schedule or fluctuating production volumes due to internal problems, such as downtime, missing parts, or defects. Mura will also cause muda. Unevenness in production levels makes it necessary to have on hand the equipment, materials, and people for the highest level of production—even if the average requirements are far less. And unevenness leads to too little work sometimes and overburden at other times—leading directly to Muri.


Muri—overburdening people or equipment. In some respects, muri is on the opposite end of the spectrum from muda. Muda is underperforming, while Muri is pushing a machine or person beyond natural limits. Overburdening people results in safety and quality problems. Overburdening equipment causes breakdowns and defects. In other words, muri can cause muda. And even worse, overburdening people can cause health and safety problems.


The slower but consistent tortoise causes less waste and is much more desirable than the speedy hare that races ahead and then stops occasionally to doze. The Toyota Production System can be realized only when all the workers become tortoises.1


At Toyota, muda is viewed as something that can be worked on by the frontline work group, but overburden and unevenness are the responsibility of management.


In manufacturing, heijunka is the leveling of production by both volume and product mix. It does not build products according to the actual flow of customer orders, which can swing up and down wildly, but takes the total volume of orders in a period and levels them out so approximately the same amount and mix are made each day for a period of time.


Customers usually do not buy products predictably. The customer is buying medium and large engines throughout the week. If the customer unexpectedly decides to buy an unusually large number of large engines early in the week, the plant is in trouble. You can get around this by holding a lot of finished-goods inventory of all engines, but this leads to an unnecessary high cost of inventory.


There were four benefits of leveling the schedule: Figure 4.3 Heijunka production (leveled). Description A visual schedule shows the number of cameras used each day from Monday to Friday, with varying quantities and sizes of cameras depicted in rows. The image is a visual schedule displaying rows of cameras arranged by day of the week, from Monday to Friday. Each row represents a specific day, with cameras of different sizes and quantities depicted. - **Monday:** The row contains five cameras, starting with a large camera on the left, followed by four smaller cameras. - **Tuesday:** The row has six cameras, beginning with a large camera, followed by five smaller cameras. - **Wednesday:** The row includes seven cameras, starting with a large camera, followed by six smaller cameras. - **Thursday:** The row contains eight cameras, beginning with a large camera, followed by seven smaller cameras. - **Friday:** The row has nine cameras, starting with a large camera, followed by eight smaller cameras. The pattern shows an increasing number of cameras each day, with one additional camera added daily. The large camera consistently appears first in each row, followed by smaller cameras. The image visually represents a progression in the number of cameras used throughout the week. 1.   Flexibility to make what the customers want when they want it. This reduced the plant’s inventory and its associated problems. 2.   Reduced risk of unsold goods. The plant built only what the customers ordered, reducing the costs of owning and storing obsolete inventory. 3.   Balanced use of labor and machines.

If the plant uses a just-in-time system for upstream processes and the suppliers deliver multiple times in a day, the suppliers will get a stable and level set of orders. This will allow the suppliers to reduce inventory and then pass some savings on to the customer so that everyone gets the benefits of leveling.
