Goal: Save costs and increase efficiency

**Tags:** orange


IT should not only support specialist areas processes optimally—as is usually the case—but also play a decisive role directly at the interface with the end customer in future.

**Tags:** orange


On the IT side, applications include business intelligence, innovative production and logistics systems, but also, for example, CRM systems.

**Tags:** orange


No IT Strategy Without Existing Corporate Strategy

**Tags:** blue


In other words: an IT strategy cannot be developed without a corporate strategy according to Gartner as well as Forrester.

**Tags:** orange


Only with clear specifications from the business can a stable and matching IT system landscape arise and be operated for so long that it pays off.

**Tags:** orange


“Which are the right investments in IT that lead to a higher return on investment for the entire company and which investments in IT are rather to be neglected?”

Most Common Reasons Why IT Strategies Fail

**Tags:** blue


When defining an IT strategy, it is always helpful to investigate beforehand what could cause it to fail.

**Tags:** orange


Areas of Application, Benefits and Target Group of an IT Strategy

**Tags:** blue


An IT strategy is particularly relevant in these company phases: Before or after company purchases or acquisitions (Mergers & Acquistion) When the company and the IT organization are growing very rapidly or have grown very rapidly After a re-organization or restructuring in the company When the complexity of processes and technology is too great When the IT landscape is outdated and no longer meets today’s requirements

Delimitation of IT Strategy to Digitalization Strategy

**Tags:** blue


Industry 4.0 in a wider sense refers to pure process improvements and the raising of efficiencies in the production or manufacturing process.

**Tags:** orange


It should be noted that the IT strategy does not replace the digitalization strategy and does not integrate it completely.

Six Good Reasons for an IT Strategy

**Tags:** blue


Organizational Challenges

**Tags:** blue


The Role of IT in the Company

**Tags:** blue


The Role of the CIO in the Company

**Tags:** blue


In the past, CIOs were mostly technologically oriented, but today managers are needed who understand the business well and are able to precisely assess where the value lever for IT is in the company.

**Tags:** orange


Tab. 1 What IT responsible consider important (in 2013) [19]

Tab. 2 Change in the role of the CIO (Brenner et al. [4])

**Tags:** pink


IT is getting closer to the business. This is called business-IT alignment.

**Tags:** orange


However, optimal business-IT alignment will only be sustainable if not only IT develops and drives business partnering, but also new roles or functions are created in the specialist department itself as a counterpart to IT.

Sourcing Problems: Management of the Supplier Portfolio

**Tags:** blue


This is what the sourcing strategy is for, which is part of step 4 of the IT strategy and an important, because cost-relevant, topic here.

**Tags:** orange


What does IT Cost?

**Tags:** blue


Fig. 2 Typical cost structure of IT organizations

**Note:** 10% plan
30% build
60% run

**Tags:** pink


The division shows the IT costs in the three blocks PLAN, BUILD and RUN.

**Tags:** orange


The PLAN area is still strongly underrepresented in many companies with only 10%; here is the IT management with planning, control, architecture, strategy and controlling.

**Tags:** orange


The BUILD area is application development and in the RUN area is the operation of IT (data center, infrastructure, telecommunications).

**Tags:** orange


The largest cost block with 60% are still the operating costs / RUN, which despite the increased demand for cloud computing and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) have already been very standardized and outsourced to specialized service providers.

**Tags:** orange


According to Gartner, the best levers for reducing IT costs with the least possible risks are the virtualization of the IT landscape with 10% long-term and approx. 3% short-term cost reduction potential. Almost 10% savings on a long-term basis are also possible through the consolidation of IT and the reduction of operating costs. However, the two measures entail greater risks: first in the form of organizational uncertainties and payback when optimizing operating costs, and second through the high investment costs when consolidating.

**Tags:** orange


Almost without risks and with approx. 3% savings potential on a short-term and 5% on a long-term basis, negotiations and improvements in contracts with external service providers are possible.

**Tags:** orange


If a well-managed license management already exists, an optimization of the used software licenses and the resulting cost reduction is an easy to achieve quick win.

**Tags:** orange


it should be the goal of IT management to make the cost structures sustainable and transparent in the long term and understandable.

**Tags:** orange


scalability is also an important criterion for IT cost management.

**Tags:** orange


In general, it can be said that it will always be a challenge for IT responsible persons to justify IT budgets using traditional benchmarking data from outside. To end these tedious discussions, the IT management must get involved in the process of developing strategy for the entire company and, as part of a subsequent IT strategy, make it clear how and with which means the company is supported by IT.

**Tags:** orange


Project Management Skills and Better Time-to-Market

**Tags:** blue


Inadequate risk calculation, software compatibility problems, lack of knowledge when implementing new technology were, according to the study, the most common reasons for the additional expenses.

**Tags:** orange


“We were shocked when the data came in and we learned that large IT projects are 20 times more likely than normal projects to spin out of control. IT projects are now so big and touch so many aspects of business, government and citizens’ lives that this poses a singular new challenge for top managers”

**Tags:** orange


Actually, one should translate Scope Management from time to time with “Expectation Management”.

**Tags:** orange

**Tags:** pink


This is exactly what IT projects need to be successful: strong engagement and involvement of top managers and departmental heads – not only in steering committees, but also in the everyday decision-making of large IT projects as Fig. 3 shows.

Preparations: Developing the IT Strategy as a Project

**Tags:** blue


Clear definition of what the content (scope) of the IT strategy is and what it is not (out-of-scope).

**Tags:** orange


This is followed by the creation of a project plan in the form of a Gantt chart or—in a simple way—in the form of a roadmap or milestone plan.

**Tags:** orange


A first estimate of effort and budget is made and then an organizational chart is created.

**Tags:** orange


Finally, a stakeholder analysis is carried out in order to better understand where and with whom in the company support for IT can be expected and where possible conflicts are dormant.

**Tags:** orange


Step 1: Status Analysis

**Tags:** blue


With the help of a questionnaire, the maturity of the IT processes is ascertained on the basis of the following four areas and visualized in a network diagram: IT processes IT governance, IT organization and employees Technology Finances

**Tags:** orange


IT strategy cannot be created on the “green meadow”, but is ideally an integral part of the company

**Tags:** orange


On the basis of this application portfolio and the application life cycle, all current applications are evaluated. From this, action options can be derived for each application (for example: keep, phase out, modernize, etc.).

**Tags:** orange


Step 4: The Sourcing Strategy

**Tags:** blue


Step 5: The IT Organization and IT Governance

**Tags:** blue


Step 5 consists of three essential components: Optimizing the IT organizational structure with the demand/supply concept presented here Checking and setting up IT governance structures in the form of new or adapted roles and responsibilities Conducting a gap analysis to create a personnel strategy for the IT organization

**Tags:** orange


Step 6: Implementation—The IT Roadmap, Determination of the IT Budget and the IT Project Portfolio

**Tags:** blue


After that, it is about the question of what the implementation of the roadmap costs.

Control Body: Project Steering Committee There should be a control body for all IT strategy projects. This body is often referred to as the “Project Steering Committee” or “Steering Committee”.

**Tags:** orange


The body should meet at regular intervals, for example every two weeks or monthly for about 2-3 hours, if necessary even longer.

Stakeholder Analysis for the IT Strategy

**Tags:** blue


Procedure for Creating a Stakeholder analysis

**Tags:** blue


Phase 1: Identification of All Relevant Stakeholders

**Tags:** blue


Phase 2.1: Evaluation of the Influence

**Tags:** blue


Phase 2.2: Evaluation of Interest

**Tags:** blue


The guiding question is: “How great is the stakeholder’s interest in the success of the project or in achieving the project goals?”

**Tags:** orange


The evaluation scale could look like this: very low: The stakeholder has no interest whatsoever in the success of your project low: The stakeholder has little to no interest medium: The interest is limited and his contribution to achieving the project goals will be manageable high: The stakeholder has a great interest in the project goals being achieved and will do a lot to make it happen very high influence: A stakeholder who has a very strong interest in the success of the project and from whom a very strong commitment is expected.

**Tags:** orange


Phase 2.3: Evaluation of the Setting

**Tags:** blue


The goal of this phase is to find out how the stakeholder feels about the project. The central question is: “How is the stakeholder’s attitude towards the project/project?”

**Tags:** orange


Criteria for the attitude towards the project/project can, for example, be the following: very positive: The stakeholder has a great interest in the success of the project and will support it fully positive: The stakeholder finds the project/project good and will be more positive. neutral: The stakeholder has little or no interest in the project and pursues no specific goal in relation to the project skeptical: The stakeholder had doubts and does not necessarily believe in the success of the project/project very skeptical: A stakeholder who does not believe in the project/project at all or considers it harmful and would like to sabotage it.

**Tags:** orange


The following points have proven to be effective: Type of involvement of the stakeholder Information Responsibility in the project or steering committee

**Tags:** orange


Time Horizon of the IT Strategy

**Tags:** blue


The IT strategy with all 7 steps should be valid for about 3-5 years, but should be constantly questioned and checked using the aforementioned strategy cockpit.

**Tags:** orange


Development of the IT strategy based on the 7 steps—time horizon: 3-5 years Derived from this: the planning and control of an IT project portfolio—time horizon: approx. 1 year Creating an IT roadmap with a long-term horizon that maps the targeted goals of the IT strategy as projects onto a timeline. In addition, the roadmap also contains the medium-term aspects derived from the project portfolio. Regular control of the company’s internal budget and planning processes as well as other events (for example, acquisitions or organizational changes) using the IT strategy cockpit—time horizon: regular control and adjustment of the IT strategy

IT Processes

**Tags:** blue


Project management: Within the scope of project management, it is checked how well projects are carried out in the respective IT organization and to what extent standards and experience for the professional implementation of IT projects are available.

**Tags:** orange


Demand Management: Within the scope of demand management, it is about the aspects of a smooth cooperation between IT and department as well as about how this is organizationally underpinned and lived. If no explicit demand management is integrated into the IT organization, but for example the IT is functionally divided, then the questions can still be answered. The interface business/IT always exists, no matter what it is called.

**Tags:** orange


Supply Management: Supply management reflects the technical core of the IT organization. It is analyzed to what extent an IT operation is professionally set up and how the interfaces between demand/supply and department are structured.

**Tags:** orange


Service Management: The focus is on the mapping of the most important ITIL processes in the area of IT operations. It is checked to what extent the most important ITIL processes are mature in the IT organization.

**Tags:** orange


Quality Assurance and Quality Management: This area deals with the quality assurance of IT processes. Are there clear quality definitions as well as methodological basics for the constant improvement of IT processes? Has a reporting been installed over several control levels and is there a monitoring of IT processes?
