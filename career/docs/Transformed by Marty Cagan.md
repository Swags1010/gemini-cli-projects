The product operating model is not a process, or even a single way of working. It is a conceptual model based on a set of first principles that strong product companies believe to be true. Principles such as the necessary role of experimentation, or prioritizing innovation over predictability.


Essentially, the product operating model is about consistently creating technology-powered solutions that your customers love, yet work for your business.


To be explicit: The CEO needs to be viewed as the chief evangelist for the product model.


In this book, we discuss the product model as change along three distinct dimensions: Changing how you build Changing how you solve problems Changing how you decide which problems to solve


Instead of stakeholders prioritizing their perceived solutions (features and projects) and providing these in the form of a roadmap to a feature team, now the product team is assigned problems to solve, and the product team is empowered to discover a solution that is valuable, usable, feasible, and viable.


Realize that everything we build has two outputs that could create value: what we make and what we learn. In the project model, we lose most of what we learn.


In the product model, products are instead managed as ongoing efforts—improving every week (in strong product companies, many times a day), typically for several years.


In fact, in most companies today, the percentage of features and projects on product roadmaps that actually generate a positive return on investment is depressingly small. Most industry analysts place it in the range of 10 to 30 percent.


The root of the issue is that these feature teams are set up to serve the stakeholders in your business, rather than to serve your customers in ways that work for your business.


This means coming up with a solution that is valuable—the customer will decide to buy or use it; usable—the user will be able to figure out how to use it; feasible—your engineers know how to solve with the time, skills, and technology on the team; and viable—the solution will work for your business in terms of constraints in marketing, sales, finance, service, legal, and compliance.


While time to market is still important for an empowered product team held accountable to results, what is most important is time to money—in other words, the time to achieve the necessary outcome.


With time to money as the goal of the product team, the incentive moves to being able to quickly determine if a particular product idea or approach will work. This is referred to as product discovery.


Mostly, the product team creates prototypes, which come in various forms, but all are very fast and inexpensive to create. Each prototype is designed to test different risks or assumptions. The general rule of thumb is that any idea tested in product discovery should be at least one order of magnitude less expensive and faster than using the engineers to build, test, and deploy an actual product. In many cases, the prototypes are two orders of magnitude less expensive than the product.


It's important to note that the product vision is, first and foremost, about the customer. How will it make the lives of your users and customers better?


As legendary CEO Jim Barksdale said, “The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.”


“If you chase two rabbits, you will not catch either one.”


But the product operating model is a conceptual model. It's a way for you to think about the work. It is not a prescription. It is not a process. There is no single framework or methodology or tool.


In prior models, product teams exist to serve the needs of the business or, more accurately, the business leaders. But in the product model, product teams exist to solve hard problems for your customers and for your business, in ways your customers love, yet work for the business.


Value risk. Will the customer buy our solution or choose to use it? Viability risk. Will this solution work for our business? Is it something we can effectively and legally market, sell, service, fund, and monetize? Usability risk. Can users easily learn, use, and perceive the value of the solution? Feasibility risk. Do we know how to build and scale this solution with the staff, time, technology, and data we have?


Value requires a deep understanding of your users and customers, and viability requires a solid understanding of your business.


Understanding your customers means not only being an expert on how your users and customers choose and use your products—both qualitatively and quantitatively—but also understanding the market, the competitive landscape, and the relevant technology and industry trends.


Understanding your business means learning how your product is funded, monetized, manufactured, marketed, sold, delivered, and serviced, as well as any legal, contractual, or compliance constraints.


Without that active coaching from a strong manager, the person could easily be in the job for multiple years and still not have the necessary knowledge. The most common visible symptom of this situation is a lack of trust in that product manager by the company's stakeholders.


One clear sign that the product team lacks a competent product manager is that all decisions require either an escalation to a manager or a stakeholder meeting where the stakeholders are asked to decide.


To set your expectations about the necessary level of skill required for this competency, here are two candid realities: Your head of product will be judged by her weakest product manager. Your CEO should believe that each of your product managers has the potential to be a future leader of your company in the next five or so years.


A very important part of transformation is identifying these high-potential people, getting them into this critical role, and providing them the necessary coaching to succeed. Look for people with a broad understanding of business and the proven ability to quickly learn other parts of the business. Look for people who are comfortable immersing in the data to understand behavior and trends. Look for people who want to get face-to-face with real users and customers. Look for people who are willing to roll up their sleeves around a whiteboard with designers and engineers to try to come up with solutions that solve for many different constraints. Look for people who love to quickly learn as much as they can and collaborate to solve hard problems.


For the product team to discover and deliver effective solutions, it is absolutely critical that they—especially the product manager—have direct, unencumbered access to these three constituencies: Users and customers Product data Business stakeholders


Direct Access to Product Data Similarly, the product manager needs direct access to the product data in order to make good decisions based on that data. Usually several data sources contain different types of data—such as how your users are interacting with your product, how your customers purchase your products, and how your customers’ behaviors are changing over time.


The product manager must establish relationships with these people, putting in real time and effort to learn the concerns and needs of the various stakeholders. Stakeholders must genuinely believe that the product manager understands the relevant constraints and will ensure they are considered and addressed in any proposed solution. And the product manager will discuss with stakeholders before building anything in that gray area where viability is not certain.


The reason this is a such an important topic is because it is so common for companies that are transforming to hire product managers out of their customer base or others with deep domain experience. However, in most cases, this turns out to be a mistake. It is likely no surprise that someone who knows too little about the domain will struggle to do the job. What is much more surprising is the problems that are caused when a product manager knows too much about the domain. To be clear, we expect new product managers to become expert in their domain in their first months of onboarding in the role. This is about the dangers of hiring people because of their preexisting domain experience.


Product thought leader Shreyas Doshi refers to true domain expertise as domain knowledge minus domain dogma. For so many people who spend many years immersed in the domain, it is very difficult to distinguish dogma from expertise. The problem is that the domain dogma seriously impedes innovation. These are the people who can recite all the reasons something won't work, until someone comes along without that dogma and shows that it can work.


It's important to acknowledge that nearly all technology looks easier until you actually get deep into it. But that said, there are some fairly significant differences around scale, performance, fault tolerance, reliability, internationalization, test automation, deployment infrastructure, new emerging technologies, and architecture and strategies for managing technical debt that distinguish product engineers. Experience with these techniques is extremely valuable, as mistakes in these areas can be very expensive.


Of all the principles underlying the product model, the single most important is the realization that innovation absolutely depends on empowered engineers.


As legendary CEO Andy Grove said, “What gets in the way of good work? There are only two possibilities. The first is that people don't know how to do good work. The second is that they know how, but they aren't motivated.”


The amount of time and effort you need to spend on coaching depends on the number and experience level of your people. But to set your expectations, it's normal for first-level managers to need to spend up to 80 percent of their workweek on staffing and coaching.


“Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will be, the single most important element of Amazon's success.”


“Lead with context, not control.”


Creating a compelling product vision is a bit different than the other elements of the strategic context. The product vision is more art than science. Its purpose is to persuade and inspire—it is meant to be emotional. You are talking about how you will improve the lives of your customers. You don't want so much detail that your teams think it's prescriptive, but you also need enough detail so people can really understand what you're trying to accomplish.


To execute on the product strategy, the leaders need to ensure that each product team has one or two clear objectives they have been assigned (typically quarterly), which spell out the problems they are being asked to solve. These objectives derive directly from the product strategy—it's where insights are turned into action.

This requires an ongoing crusade of evangelizing—in recruiting, onboarding, weekly 1:1 coaching, all-hands meetings, team lunches, board meetings, customer briefings, and everything in between.


An empowered product team exists to solve problems in ways that your customers love, yet work for your business.


Shipping lots of features may make you feel good, but unless that translates into real business results, you fail.


As Steve Jobs said, “People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.”


Most important, the product vision describes how the world will be better from the point of view of your customers. The product strategy is from the point of view of your company, but the product vision is all about your customers.


The first principle in product discovery is to try to solve the problem with a minimum amount of wasted time and effort. This is why product discovery is the key to accelerated time to money.

Value risk—You might build the product only to find that your customers don't feel it's sufficiently better than what they currently have, and they're not willing to buy it or choose to use it and switch.


Usability risk—You might build the product only to find that your users can't figure out how to do what they need to, or are otherwise not aligned to how they think about the problem because the product is too confusing, or not behaving as they would expect, or the learning curve is too steep.


Viability risk—You might build the product only to find that there are legal, compliance, partnership, or ethical issues you hadn't realized that prevent you from selling this product. You might build the product only to find that your marketing and sales organizations aren't aligned with what this product needs to get into the hands of customers. You might build the product only to find that operational costs are too high and/or you can't generate sufficient revenue to sustain this business.

Feasibility risk—You might find it takes so much longer to build than you had originally thought that your costs become so high you can't afford to actually build and deliver this product.


As Jeff Bezos warns: “Good process serves you so you can serve customers. But if you're not watchful, the process can become the thing. This can happen very easily in large organizations…The process is not the thing. It's always worth asking, do we own the process or does the process own us?”


“That's what makes great products. It's not process; it's content…The system is that there is no system. That doesn't mean we don't have process…But that's not what it's about.”


The reason Netflix has been so successful is because it has] a culture that values people over process, emphasizes innovation over efficiency, and has very few controls.”


are known. Process helps ensure that you can deliver solutions that scale without breaking other parts of the organization…These processes reduce risk to an overall organization, but each layer of process reduces the ability to be agile and lean and—most important—be responsive to new opportunities and threats.”


If a person makes a mistake, you can either add a process that is intended to prevent that mistake from happening again, or you can provide some coaching so the person understands how they might better handle the situation going forward. If you're trying to empower your people with a true sense of ownership and push decisions down to the product teams and closer to the users, then you'll need to make coaching a pillar of what your managers are responsible for. Coaching includes teaching skills and principles, and also sharing the strategic context—the larger picture of the product vision and product strategy.


Product Delivery Once the product team has discovered and developed the necessary solutions, you have additional obligations to appropriately serve your customers: First, you promise to effectively test your solutions, which means two different activities. You will test that the new capability works as expected. You will test that the new capability does not inadvertently introduce any problems elsewhere. These are called regressions, and while preventing regressions is difficult, and sometimes they occur despite best efforts, you also acknowledge you have a responsibility to ensure that new capabilities do not come along with unexpected problems.


Rather than make funding decisions on a project basis, product asks that you staff product teams with specific focus areas and measures of business results, for one or more quarters. The product teams will provide real-time business results with results judged quarterly.


Rather than being judged on shipping features and projects, the product teams ask to be judged on business impact. To do this, the product teams need the room to run the necessary tests and make decisions about which features and projects will best meet the objectives. The intention is to leave this level of granularity to the product teams.


Culture Retrospectives There are many forms of retrospectives, but at least every quarter it is a good idea to get some of your most progressive product, design, and engineering leaders together to discuss how they think the organization managed to do its work the preceding quarter, and what they think should be the emphasis for the next quarter. They would normally look at topics such as: The level of process versus the understanding of the principles How much was still top-down command and control, and how much was pushed down to the product teams The level of experimentation in discovery versus products that failed after delivery The level of innovation in the ideas that were explored, and the contribution of the engineers to that innovation The degree to which members of product teams understand the strategic context and the product model The level of trust between the product teams and the various stakeholders and executives The organization's ability to deliver on its high-integrity commitments


The legendary coach Bill Campbell was famous for saying “Coaching is no longer a specialty; you cannot be a good manager without being a good coach.” This is why, at the best product model companies, the number-one attribute of strong managers is that they are considered good coaches.
