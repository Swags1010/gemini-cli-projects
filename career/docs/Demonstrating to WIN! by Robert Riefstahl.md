# Demonstrating to WIN! by Robert Riefstahl

Many people’s livelihoods depend on you. It’s your obligation to be the best you can be at presenting your software. If you truly believe in your products and services, you owe it to all the people within your company to provide your prospective customers a compelling view of your products.


really good but mean absolutely nothing in their business. They want to know how your products and services will help make them more productive, competitive and profitable. That’s it. Nothing more. Nothing less.


You’re not there to teach your prospect about your software. Their understanding your software isn’t the mark of an effective demonstration. It’s not an educational session in the traditional sense. You’re presenting your software for the sole purpose of providing them with a vision of how it can improve their company. That’s it.


the software they buy. They will concentrate solely on what helps them in their work. You are there to bring focus to those areas and help them see how the advantages they will realize if they implement your solutions.


Being nervous simply shows you respect the significance of the task you’re about to begin. When you become anxiety-crippled, you’re ineffective.


If you are conducting a web demonstration, Discovery will more likely be done over the phone. But every demonstration should be preceeded by Discovery activities. As you become more familiar with your product, industry and competition, you can usually perform your Discovery the day before the demonstration. Until that point, schedule Discovery interviews at least one week in advance. This will give you ample time to incorporate what you learn into your presentation.


I always, always, always ask each individual, “If it was completely up to you, what three things would you change about your existing system?” Then ask, “What are the three best things about your existing system?” If appropriate, ask, “What are the three things you’d like demonstrated when I come back?”


goals in the Discovery are many: Learn more about the organization. (Note that the internet is a great source of information about the company, their financial details, and their industry.) Establish a relationship with the people to whom you’ll be presenting and what’s important to them. Determine the issues that are really important to your audience. What are their current issues, desired outcomes and the impact of making those changes? Identify your weaknesses so you can prepare and provide responses during the demonstration. Establish credibility by showing that you care about them, as individuals and as a company, by investing your own time learning as much as you can.


2) Prospect’s Industry - Your prospect belongs to a certain industry. Most prospects fall into what is referred to as a Standard Industry Classification or SIC code. The prospect’s SIC code defines their primary business. Why is this important to know? If your prospect sees that you understand (or are trying hard to learn) something about their industry, they’ll be more likely to respect and listen to you.


Even if your direct audience is technical, you will need to sell your advantages “up the chain” to business decision makers. If you understand the business and the industry, you can better provide them what they will need to sell internally.


Value Drivers – All organizations have key metrics by which they measure themselves. Your prospect is no different. Knowing those metrics is necessary in order for you to build a strong value case for your solution. Every prospect has a long list of projects and initiatives they would like to address, but their capital is limited.


Competition - “Who’s my competition?” Always ask your prospect this important question. Don’t be afraid to ask the question, especially if you have an insider in the organization.


In situations where competitors have acquired products, look at their reputation and track record at integrating and supporting acquired products. Understand the reputation and position of the product pre- and postacquisition.


Often, your prospect will ask, “Why are you better than your competitor?” If they ask you this question, you should be prepared with an “Elevator Pitch” which is a rehearsed answer for an anticipated question.


follows that of its leadership. This is true with every organization I know. If the CEO or key executive is low-key, so is the organization. If the CEO or key executive is well organized, so is the organization. With this in mind, you generally want to establish the tone of your demonstration based on the personality of the organization’s leader(s).


Prospect’s Operating and Technical Environment- Who are the prospect’s best customers, suppliers, and partners? What are their key product lines or services? What is the nature of their current technical environment? Are they a “Linux shop” or a “java shop”? If you know specific examples of their data or architecture and are prepared to use them in your demonstration, you put your prospect on familiar territory.


9) Equipment – Do yourself and your prospect this favor: know how to operate the equipment you bring to your demonstration!


won’t connect with you or your software.


Process flows are key to a successful demonstration. They’re the routines of the business world. Ignore them and your demonstration will inevitably fail. Exploit them and your demonstration will soar.


to each prospect) so they won’t surprise you during the demonstration. By properly planning for your perceived weaknesses, you can minimize their impact. On occasion, you can even turn a weakness into strengths!


Demonstrating software is not an art. No, a winning software demonstration is the right blend of preparation, knowledge, and technique. Know everything you can about your product, competition and prospect.


The “Bridge-Building” concept is the most important fundamental you can learn about demonstrating. This concept involves bridging the mental gap between how your prospect performs their job today and how they’ll perform it with your software in the future.


Webster’s dictionary defines inertia as “…an object retains its state of rest or velocity along a straight line so long as it is not acted upon by an external force.” In business speak, that means change is hard. Your prospect has an inner physical or mental force that says, “I don’t want to change.”


In all likelihood, change is being forced on your prospect. They’re probably facing some compelling or significant event. It’s your job to identify this event, especially as it relates to the ultimate decision-maker.


OK, let’s apply this technique to a software demonstration situation. “Bill, at this point I’m going to show you how quickly service reps can access customer information. When a call comes in, the customer’s name and number appear automatically. When the service rep accepts the call, all of the customer’s information, including a call history, automatically displays on-screen. We simply have to accept the call (tell). You now demo the software accepting the call and displaying the information (show). Did you see that? It still amazes me how fast and easy it is to get the information. Just think about how much faster it it will be for your service people and how pleased customers will be with not having to constantly repeat information (tell).” Notice how it’s simple and to the point. You demonstrated a single feature of your software and combined it with a single benefit for the prospect. This technique makes it easier for the prospect to absorb your feature along with its corresponding benefit.


The more technical and detailed your presentation, the more critical the Tell-Show-Tell technique becomes.


You see, Rusty knows in order for the audience to cross the Bridge with him, they need to see the process flow without interruptions. Sometimes the same person will insist on interrupting again, so Rusty politely fends off the question a second time.


The best way to build trust is by establishing credibility.


they’re going to cross the Bridge, your prospect needs to have confidence in you. Nothing builds confidence more than the way you address their questions. Notice I said address, not answer. Don’t confuse confidence with pure knowledge.


Your entire demonstration should wrap around your theme. Here are a couple suggestions: Introduce it when you open the demonstration. Even if it is only a 30 minute web demo, always open with a theme. Lace your theme into as many aspects of your initial presentation as possible. Tie the value (the benefits) of what you are showing back to that theme, helping to reinforce it. A theme should differentiate you from your competition, thus becoming a competitive advantage. Don’t pick a theme you can’t build a story around. Pick a theme you’re personally passionate about.


For example, assume that you are selling a software product for Business Intelligence (BI) and you have selected the theme “Better Information for Better Decisions”. Craft an opening that gives an example of how better information did, or would have, led to a better decision. The example might be from another customer or might not be from the software industry at all. History is full of examples where decisions would have been different if information was more complete or better known. Then, when you are presenting the capabilities of your software, continue to emphasize the improvements in information availability and visibility. In each case, tie this to the impact that this information would have on decision making for your prospect. At the end of the day, tie your software back to the theme and make sure that your prospect understands how better access to their information would lead to better decisions in their organization. Bring it to completion by ensuring that the prospect sees the impact of those improved decisions.


If you cannot, for some reason, perform a proper Discovery and find yourself being pummeled with unanticipated questions during a demonstration, you have to put the brakes on and regain control. How? Turn the tables and start asking questions. In other words, make the Discovery part of the presentation. Ask the prospect to help you list on a flipchart all the things they want to make sure your software will do during the demonstration. Once you’ve finished, tell them when you’ll be covering each item and note that on the flipchart as well. Leave the flipchart in plain view during the demonstration. This will serve as a reminder to your prospect that you won’t skip these items.


That was a turning point for me. From that moment on, I’ve always focused on bringing each prospect’s business, products and situations into my demonstrations!

Some key phrases will warn you that you’re about to begin meandering: Which by the way… In addition to… Oh by the way… We also can… I forgot to mention… Another feature we offer is… Not only can we… If you find yourself using one of these phrases, catch yourself and STOP! If you have trouble recognizing when you do this, ask a teammate to flash you a non-verbal signal when you start committing the crime.

Train yourself to internally ask the question “So What?” after every software feature you demonstrate. This is a very important element of successful demonstrating. Here’s the bottom line: don’t make statements of functionality without following with some type of benefit.

I make it a point to ask myself the question “So What?” after each software feature. You should too. It will help you: Get your points across. Establish the value of your software to your prospect. Bring your prospect across the Bridge. If a feature has no benefit to the prospect, there’s no sense in demonstrating it.

The “So What?” crime helps to summarize this section on “Featuring” crimes. Our goal is always to make software capabilities understandable and relevant to the prospect. With every “featuring” crime, we stray from that goal. Applying the “So What?” test will eliminate most of these crimes from your demonstration.

Whenever I get questions from prospects that I didn’t have a chance to spend time with prior to the demonstration, I answer their questions with questions. This allows us to find out many things. First and foremost,

**Tags:** orange


Generally, I avoid answering direct questions with direct answers during a demonstration. Unless I’m 100 percent positive my answer is exactly what they want to hear, I’ll answer with another question.


I was watching a senior Solution Engineers from one of our large corporate client’s perform a demo to a multimillion-dollar prospect when the realization about this crime came to me. He was starting a section of the demo with a summary of all of the prospect’s pains. I watched the reaction of the prospect and saw an amazing change in their body language and demeanor. The people he was presenting the pain to were leaning back, folding their arms and frowning.


Be very careful with pain. If you address it directly, you run the risk of committing this crime. Don’t start your demo or a section of the demo telling them how bad they run their operations. It can be insulting, irritating and generally puts them in a bad mood. Let your competitor who’s been through the same sales training put them in a bad mood.


Make your demonstration as personal and close to the prospect as possible. Try to transform them from presentations into meaningful, relevant conversations. Don’t fall into the lazy habit of always showing the same information or citing the same examples to every prospect. Never demonstrate data that’s sterile and generic. Your prospects are all different and all have unique needs. Customize your demonstration, including examples and benefit statements, to fit their situation. They’ll be much more likely to identify with you and your software.


Skip the technology and marketing jargon and speak in the prospect’s language. Prospects can relate to and understand their language, but not your jargon. Their company, industry or personal “speak” may contain jargon, but it’s their jargon.


Many pre-sales and sales people use presentation slides as a crutch and most prospects don’t appreciate it in the least. Prospects want to see a software demonstration from a real person who can lead them across the Bridge from their old system to a new, highly productive one. They’ve spent a lot of money to sit through your presentation and they want steak, not just sizzle.


The diagnosis of a poor presentation reveals three primary symptoms: Lack of a primary message. Incorrect perspective – yours versus the clients. Too much clutter which defocuses the prospect.


There’s nothing wrong with an organized, focused slide presentation. I use them in every demonstration. However, they should never: Be more than 30 minutes long. Contain more than 15 slides. Have more than six bullet-points on a slide. Have an overabundance of bullet point slides. Use an overabundance of cute graphics and animations.


Of those listed above, the Presentation Crutch is certainly the most serious. In fact, most presenters would win more deals, please more prospects, and have more fun if they just spent some quality time with their slides. Take the first step and revamp your slide deck(s) to cut out all the irrelevant information, replace words with images, and simplify your messages. Then spend a little time before each demonstration to customize the slides to properly reflect the prospect’s interests and concerns.


If you’re not the person at the front of the room, your job is easy – don’t jump in unless the presenter asks you to.


Respected professionals like doctors, lawyers and accountants are required to participate in continuing education every year. Every professional sport has a training camp where players practice fundamental skills before the season begins. Teams and individuals practice throughout a season to ensure their fundamentals remain sharp. Why expect anything less from our profession? Commit yourself to continuing education and practice. Constantly drill yourself on demo crimes. Look for outside help and expertise to improve your demonstration techniques and processes. It’s only through a constant personal commitment to continuing education that you will remain crime-free.


Granted, it’s not practical for all software demonstrations to begin with a full-blown Discovery. For example, you wouldn’t perform a Discovery process if: You sell in a retail environment and a prospect walks-up to you requesting a demonstration of Apple iTunes. You’re an inside or base-account salesperson responsible for selling additional software to a nationwide customer base. It is still important to gather as much information as practical, but a full Discovery for small upgrades is cost prohibitive. You are at a trade show and someone walks into your booth and requests a demonstration. The price of your software doesn’t justify the time and expense for a full Discovery. Do not, however, use this as a justification for not learning what you can about your prospect.


When you do, be sure that these points are always covered in your questions: Why is the prospect interested in the solutions that you have been asked to present? What problems are they trying to solve or what opportunities are they trying to exploit? Within the prospect, which individuals should you focus on, both during Discovery and during any presentations or demonstrations? Who is the champion and who is the detractor? Where are we in the sales process? If your interaction with the prospect is successful, what will be the next step? What is our overriding message for this prospect? What financial values are we trying to find or validate, and what shape will our eventual value proposition take?


In fact, it is just starting. With a better idea of why you are involved, you can now turn your attention to the prospect themselves. In other words, you can do research. I like to do three types of research: Industry, Prospect, and Opportunity.


Those of you who demonstrate a technical, middle-ware solution might be wondering why it is important to understand how a company measures itself. With the increased need to cost justify capital and expense expenditures, you need to understand how your technical solution can contribute to their organizational goals.


You’ve set the expectation that the Discovery is a time for you to learn about them. Don’t blow your…


As a final point to consider in conducting your interviews, remember that you are there to understand three aspects of every process or capability: Current: How is a job currently done? What gaps or problems currently exist? What systems are utilized to help automate or simplify the current method of working? Desired: What changes would the interviewee like to see in this particular area? Don’t assume that your solution will be the answer, probe to find out the answer that the interviewee most favors. Impact: As we have already discussed, change is hard. So there should always be a reward for change. If you can…


After interviewing everybody, I find it helpful to categorize all the buying-motivation responses. I do this in the left pages of my Discovery Log; Rusty uses his Interview Profile. I use the following groups when I do this exercise:          a) Micro-job-functionality.          b) Strategic.          c) Political.          d) “Anything is Better Than What We have Now.”          e) No-change.          f) No-response.


During the interview, I never suggested or disclosed the capabilities of our software and how it could solve Charlie’s problems. I was saving that for the demonstration. This was the time to listen, not sell. While doing a Discovery, always remember the age-old saying “You were given two ears and one mouth for good reason!”


To summarize, your agenda needs to be dynamic and very carefully planned, incorporating the following elements: An exciting opening. An initial topic addressing the primary need of your prospect. Main body of relevant topics (buying-motivations). A compelling conclusion. Customized for each prospect.


An opening needs to consist of the following elements: Make it personalized. You can use a similar opening for multiple prospects as long as each one is tweaked to fit the needs of your audience. The opening is conversational in nature and sometimes contains a story about a customer of yours that they respect. It usually incorporates the theme of the demonstration developed specifically for them. Make it interesting and show them what they are interested in first. Create definitive takeaways. Takeaways are messages or information you want your audience to “take with them” when they leave your demonstration. They make for a powerful opening. Produce a call to action. You’re going to ask for something at the end of the demonstration. It doesn’t have to be a signed contract or a commitment to buy your product. Your call to action needs to be something they will do if you accomplish your goals, whether it’s a contract, a visit to one of your customers or a trip to your corporate office.

“Bob, what do you think makes your software so unique that we should buy it over your competitor’s?” Do you remember what you’re going to do at this point? Deliver an Adaptable Value Proposition.

Transition into your closing by summarizing the action items you noted throughout the demonstration. This will be easy if you’ve been writing them down on a flipchart or in your demonstration notes. This is an important step because it reminds your prospect you’ve been listening and willing to respond to their questions and concerns.

Follow-up - Take the notes from the demonstration (Demonstration Plan, Discovery Log, etc.) and consolidate them immediately. Time is of the essence. While everything is fresh in your mind, put all the notes into one concise report with a section at the bottom called Action Items. Have it sorted by your teammates so they know exactly what’s expected of them. Make sure everyone understands his or her deadlines.

If the decision-maker is highly organized or needs a quick response, don’t use this approach. Organized individuals don’t like a steady stream of correspondence. They prefer one nice, neat and organized summary they can three-hole punch and place neatly in a binder. You’ll make good points if you do all this for them. (Making sure the binder has your company’s name on it of course!)
