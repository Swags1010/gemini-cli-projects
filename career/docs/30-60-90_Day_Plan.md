## First 30 Days: Foundation & Learning

**Theme:** Your primary goal is to become a sponge. Learn about Amtech's products, people, processes, and customers, and lay the groundwork for a strategic territory plan.

### Key Goals:

1.  **Complete Onboarding & Learn the Ropes:**
    *   Actively participate in and complete all formal onboarding and training modules.
    *   **Action:** Master the internal tools, especially the CRM (e.g., Salesforce).
    *   **Action:** Review the `AmtechLLCBenefitsPacket01012026.pdf` to understand your benefits and enroll as needed.
    *   **Action:** Review the company's Commission Plan to fully understand your quota and compensation structure.

2.  **Build Key Internal Relationships:**
    *   **Action:** Schedule 30-minute introductory meetings with your key partners in Product Management, Customer Support, and Professional Services (PS).
    *   **Action:** In these meetings, ask "How can I be a great partner to you?" and "What does a successful sales-to-your-team handoff look like?".

3.  **Analyze and Tier Your Territory:**
    *   **Action:** Once you receive your 200-250 accounts, immediately apply the principles from the **"Fruitful Territory Framework by Kyle Asay.pdf"**.
    *   **Action:** Manually score and segment your accounts into **Priority 1** (clear Use Case and Budget signals), **Priority 2** (Use Case or Budget), and **Priority 3** (neither). Focus 80%+ of your energy on Priority 1.
    *   **Action:** For your top 20-30 "Priority 1" accounts, begin developing a **Point-of-View** as described in the "Buyer Approved Discovery Blueprint". Research company objectives (news, reports) and team objectives (LinkedIn profiles, job descriptions) to form an initial hypothesis of their needs.

## Days 31-60: Strategic Execution & Early Wins

**Theme:** Transition from learning to strategic execution. Use a structured, buyer-centric approach to generate momentum and revenue.

### Key Goals:

1.  **Execute the Discovery Blueprint:**
    *   **Action:** Begin strategic outreach to your "Priority 1" accounts. When you get a meeting, don't just "do discovery"—execute the **"Buyer Approved Discovery Blueprint"** step-by-step:
        1.  **Share Your Point-of-View:** Show you've done your homework.
        2.  **Validate Priorities:** Ask what you got wrong and have them rank their true priorities.
        3.  **Understand Current State:** Deeply explore how they solve their top priority today.
        4.  **Uncover Blockers & Negative Consequences:** Find the friction and, most importantly, the business pain (the "so what?").
    *   **Action:** Use this structured approach to qualify opportunities and ensure you are working on deals that can close.

2.  **Generate "Quick Win" Pipeline to Cover Your Draw:**
    *   **Action:** Your goal is to recoup your $6,000 draw. Your best source for this is your "Priority 1" accounts where you can identify clear "Negative Consequences" that Amtech can solve quickly.
    *   **Action:** Partner with Customer Support to identify accounts with high satisfaction scores and a clear Use Case for an additional product or service. These are prime candidates for a quick upsell.

3.  **Deepen Internal Collaboration:**
    *   **Action:** Use the `3x3x3_Multithreading_Cheat_Sheet.pdf` to build relationships with multiple contacts within your key accounts. This is critical for deals with multiple stakeholders.
    *   **Action:** Partner with a Sales Engineer or PS consultant, bringing them into a discovery call where you can jointly uncover the "After State" and "Positive Business Outcomes" with a customer.

## Days 61-90: Ownership & Impact

**Theme:** Take full ownership of your territory. Run your book of business with a predictable, repeatable process that leads to measurable impact.

### Key Goals:

1.  **Drive Predictable Revenue:**
    *   **Action:** Your forecast should be grounded in the "Buyer Approved Discovery Blueprint." For each deal in your forecast, you should be able to clearly articulate the customer's **Priorities, Blockers, Negative Consequences, and desired Positive Business Outcomes.**
    *   **Action:** For complex deals, use the `Mutual_Action_Plan_Template_1_.xlsx` to ensure alignment with your champion and a clear path to closing.
    *   **Action:** Build a robust pipeline for Q2 based on your ongoing territory-tiering and outreach efforts.

2.  **Establish Strategic Account Plans:**
    *   **Action:** For your top 10 "Priority 1" accounts, develop detailed account plans using templates like `Enterprise Account Maps Template.docx` to map out the organization and your long-term strategy for expansion.
    *   **Action:** Conduct Business Reviews with your top customers, but instead of just a status update, use it as an opportunity to share customer stories and co-create the "After State" as described in the blueprint.

3.  **Become a Trusted Resource:**
    *   **Action:** Proactively bring insights and feedback from your customers to the Product Management team. Frame the feedback in terms of "Blockers" and "Negative Consequences" you're observing in the market.
    *   **Action:** By the end of 90 days, you will have a repeatable system for managing your territory and running discovery calls, leading to a predictable forecast and making you a valuable member of the Amtech team.
