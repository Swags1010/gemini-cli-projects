# The Toyota Way to Service Excellence by Jeffrey K. Liker, Karyn Ross

These values eventually become the guiding principles of Toyota Motor Company and included:    Contribute to society.    Put the customer first and the company second.    Show respect for all people.    Know your business from the ground up.    Get your hands dirty.    Work hard and with discipline.    Work as a team.    Build in quality.    Continually improve toward a vision.


Based on the teachings of Sakichi Toyoda, the Toyoda Precepts were created, which still guide the company today: 1. Be contributive to the development and welfare of the country by working together, regardless of position, in faithfully fulfilling your duties. 2. Be ahead of the times through endless creativity, inquisitiveness, and pursuit of improvement. 3. Be practical and avoid frivolity. 4. Be kind and generous; strive to create a warm, homelike atmosphere. 5. Be reverent, and show gratitude for things great and small in thought and deed.

The concept of “waste” in lean is central but often misunderstood. Waste is more than specific actions or objects that need to be eliminated. Waste is anything that causes a deviation from the perfect process. The perfect process gives the customers exactly what they want, in the amount they want, when they want it, and all steps that deliver value do so without interruption.


The process of improvement is kaizen, relentless experimentation, with learning from each experiment informing the next.


The Toyota Way is often spoken about as “true north,” a beacon that guides daily behavior and helps everyone detect whether they are on track or off track. The very basis of continuous improvement is to identify gaps between the actual and ideal and work relentlessly to reduce those gaps, including gaps in our own skills and behaviors.


The Toyota Way is a philosophy, way of thinking, and system of interconnected processes and people who are continuously striving to improve how they work and better deliver value to each customer.


The Toyota Way begins with a passion for solving problems for each customer and society. The underlying values of challenge, kaizen, genchi genbutsu (go study the actual conditions and learn), respect, and teamwork are the foundation of the system and support the twin pillars of continuous improvement and respect for people:


Continuous improvement means everybody, everywhere, constantly looking for new and better ways to satisfy each customer by experimenting toward challenging goals, striving to reach true north.


Respect for people means developing people both personally and professionally through challenging them to be the very best that they can be. Respect for people encompasses those who work for Toyota, as well as suppliers, the community, the environment, and the larger world.

We have to give people a reason to come to us and keep coming back. We are going to treat them like royalty. We are going to wow them and service the hell out of them and have the customers believe that the only reason we got up in the morning was on the chance that they would grace us with their patronage.


Einar started out by determining exactly what Volvo customers valued in automotive service. He had learned from a survey of 100,000 customers that the top three things they wanted were (1) positive relationships, (2) time reduced to the minimum, and (3) good problem solving to service and repair their cars.


It is well known in psychology that satisfaction depends as much on expectations as reality. You can lower satisfaction either by failing to live up to current expectations or by raising expectations and then not meeting them. This leads to a conundrum: the better we do, the more the customers expect and the more difficult they are to please. That has been the story of the auto industry triggered by the excellence of Japanese automakers, particularly Toyota. Customer expectations are through the roof, and high quality and safety are basic expectations just to be in the game.


Perhaps instead of thinking of service versus manufacturing, for the purposes of improving, it is more useful to think in terms of the complexity of the work:    Customization of work. How routine (steps, sequence, time) is the operation (low) versus how specific is it to the unique situation (high)?    Intangibility of work. How much can we physically see the transformation process (low) versus how much do we need abstract ways to describe it (high)?


The process of understanding the customer and properly designing the service is similar to creating excellent product design. We must understand what customers expect and then go beyond that, giving them the unexpected. As Henry Ford quipped, “If I asked people what they wanted they would have said faster horses.” We cannot expect the customers to know what would address their need. They are not the designers of the service and are generally limited by their own experiences.


Mass goods distribution. Major customer desires are functionality, reliability, cost, and convenience.


Standard experience. Customer desires are similar to mass goods distribution with the addition of the human touch in interacting with the customer. We expect efficient service delivery that addresses our need at low cost, and we want to be treated respectfully.


Personalized goods distribution. Customers want something special that they cannot get from the average company and that distinguishes them from the masses. It should solve their unique problem, not the problem of a generic set of customers.


Personalized experience. This is perhaps the most challenging of the service types in that customers want to be wowed, pampered, and treated like VIPs. They want a memorable experience, and they are willing to pay extra for it. This is luxury service, and it is only the person’s particular experience that matters, not the experience of anyone else.


Excellent firms don’t believe in excellence—only in constant improvement and constant change. —Tom Peters, author of The Little Big Things: 163 Ways to Pursue EXCELLENCE


makes a high-performance organization (HPO). He has learned that HPOs have a culture characterized by the following factors:6    Long-term orientation. Continuity over short-term profit, collaboration with others, good long-term relationships with all stakeholders, focus on customers.    High-quality management. Decisive, action oriented, strong trust relationships, coaching, holding others responsible.    Open and action-oriented management. Communicating often with employees, open to change, performance oriented.    High-quality employees. Recruiting those who want to assume responsibility and excel, from diverse backgrounds; those who are complementary, flexible, and resilient.    Continuous improvement and innovation. A distinctive strategy; processes that are continuously improved, simplified, and coordinated; core competencies and products continuously improved; reporting important and correct information.


When we use the term “lean,” it broadly speaks to service excellence including the following characteristics:    The ideal is always continuous flow of value to the customer without waste.    Continuous improvement means both small steps and breakthroughs coming from innovative thinking.    Organizations respect people enough to invest in developing them.


We learned that the most highly rated service organizations have some common features, including a heavy emphasis on developing leaders, teamwork, and continuous improvement.


Perhaps because of its remarkable long-term success, the biggest fear of every Toyota president is complacency.


Developing people is the number one responsibility of every Toyota leader from the president to the team leader on the shop floor.


He set an immediate target of 10 hours per manager per week, which required eliminating a lot of non-value-added administrative tasks. The long-term goal was 70 percent of a manager’s time at the gemba acting as a coach to facilitate improvement.


Clarify the problem relative to the ideal (Plan). Few problem-solving efforts start with defining the ideal state. By defining the ideal state first, TBP pulls the problem solver out of the present situation and its seemingly intractable problems and focuses her on envisioning what the process could be like if it were functioning to perfection. As well as envisioning a perfect future state, in order to clarify the problem relative to the ideal, a deep understanding of the current state must be developed. And the only way to do this is by going to directly study the gemba, the place where the problems are occurring, so that the gaps between the ideal and reality become glaring.


Purpose: Connecting to the fundamental idea of Toyota. This includes the customer is number one and better car value through the “3Cs for harmonious growth”—communication, consideration, and cooperation.


Plan. Share our objectives through our common format and process. Do. Develop and customize the Toyota standard for local operations. Check. Evaluate operations from qualitative (go and see) and quantitative (key performance indicators) points of view. Act. Share the knowledge and the know-how throughout all of Toyota and further develop our methods.


Philosophy. What is the purpose of our organization? In excellent companies this always goes beyond enriching owners of the business. Customers do not pay to enrich owners. What will the organization contribute to customers better than anyone else? What are the organization’s core values? What is important to the organization as a minisociety?

Process. The ideal process from the customer’s point of view is always one-piece flow: the customer orders exactly what he wants or needs, and it comes immediately, as it is needed, in the amount it is needed. Customers pay for value added, not for extra activities that involve people or things waiting, or work being done over because of defects, or extraneous material or information being generated. Internally, one-piece flow means continuous value-added work from step to step. There are some guidelines on the best way to accomplish this, such as working in a leveled way, without huge peaks and valleys in the workload. Technology can be important to the process, but it is not the process. The process needs to be carefully designed and then improved as conditions change and as we learn more.


People. Every mission statement I have ever read talks about how important people in the organization are, but the organization rarely treats people as the most valued resource. In most companies, people are “empowered” by giving them training and resources and “getting out of their way.” In the Toyota Way that is considered downright disrespectful. People need to be simultaneously challenged to stretch to new levels of performance and coached so they can learn and be successful, the essence of OJD. At Toyota, it is actively developing people, not leaving them on their own, that shows how important people are in the organization and how much they are respected.


Problem solving. This is a term you hear constantly within Toyota, but our usual image of what it means to solve a problem is a shell of the intended meaning. We often think of problem solving as reactive. The dam is leaking, so plug the hole. As we saw with TBP, the team member in Toyota needs to start by asking, “What is the purpose of the dam?” Answer: “A regulated flow of water.” “What would be the ideal state?” Answer: “Water flows without interruption only at the volume and speed we need.” “How can I get closer to this ideal?” And so it continues. Problem solving then becomes aspirational rather than reactive and leads to innovation rather than quick fixes. Problem solving becomes a process of learning, which, when shared appropriately, builds a learning organization.


Philosophy. Delivering service excellence is a long-term philosophy, not a strategy focusing only on short-term financial rewards:    What is your organization’s purpose, and how will the company contribute to society through the service it delivers?


Jonah repeatedly asks what the goal of the business is. The only acceptable answer—to make money. The “theory of constraints” provided the only solution needed to meet the goal. Find and break any constraints to making money.


Karyn and I experience this routinely in trying to advise our clients. Even after we lead them through exercises in which they conclude that their processes are broken and their people disengaged, they still ask, “What is the return on investment of lean? Can you take me to benchmark an organization like mine that has gone lean and where I can see the results?” We want to grab them by the shoulders, stare them in the eyes, and shout, “You just mapped your value stream, you led the exercise, you saw 10 times as much waste as value added, your customers are screaming for better quality and more timely service, we identified a great future vision, and you are asking about ROI?” Clearly, shouting at somebody would be counterproductive and more likely to lead to a harassment lawsuit than a change in thinking. However, we do need to find a way to shift thinking from short-term cost reduction and immediate ROI to investing to achieve a longer-term purpose.

We are beginning by investing in people doing localized projects so they can develop the skills to take on broader projects and coach more people, and we are confident we will get a multiplier effect over time in satisfying customers, increasing revenue, and decreasing cost. We cannot precisely calculate exactly what the ROI will be, or how long it will take to get it, but we are confident it will have a large and sustainable impact over time on sales and cost reduction. In order to accomplish this, senior leaders must understand that improvement is not a “program” but a philosophy that connects their people, processes, systems, and customers together in an organic, living system.


It seems rather obvious to them that doing the right thing for the customer and society and developing people at all levels of the organization to continually innovate is the true path to sustainable competitiveness.


Conventional project management attempts to define what to do and when by defining a detailed plan and trying to stick to it. . . . This almost never works. Lean companies create a web of small, constantly operating, rapid, cadenced cycles. —Allen Ward and Durward Sobek, Lean Product and Process Development


1. Processes are theoretical concepts that involve the interdependence of many people and the way their work is completed, not concrete things waiting to be “leaned out” using a generic, prepackaged solution. 2. We suggest following these six steps as a general, high-level approach to improving processes and simultaneously developing people in any organization:    Be sure that senior leadership is serious about a need for change.    Understand senior leadership’s vision and strategy to achieve business objectives and fulfill the organization’s purpose.    Grasp the situation about how the company is currently performing in relation to senior leadership’s vision.    Understand the current state of work processes in relation to challenges the business is facing.    Identify gaps and prioritize so that big gaps can be divided into smaller, more manageable chunks of work to be improved on right away.    Strive for the future state through small cycles of learning using the iterative process of Plan-Do-Check-Act.


The supposition is prevalent the world over that there would be no problems in production or service if only our production workers would do their jobs in the way that they were taught. Pleasant dreams. The workers are handicapped by the system, and the system belongs to the management. —Dr. W. Edwards Deming, quality guru
