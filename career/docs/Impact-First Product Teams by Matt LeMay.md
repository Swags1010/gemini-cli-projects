# Impact-First Product Teams by Matt LeMay

Product teams that put the business impact of their work front-and-center are working with, not against, the existential reality of their situation.


“There is nothing quite so useless as doing with great efficiency something that should not be done at all.” —Peter Drucker, Managing for Business Effectiveness, 1963


CEO Daniel Ek described the following challenge at the heart of his decision: “Today, we still have too many people dedicated to supporting work and even doing work around the work rather than contributing to opportunities with real impact.”1


Product teams now stand to bear the brunt of business-level outcomes—which means that product teams must deeply understand their business-level impact, even if they are not explicitly tasked with doing so.


Simply put, choosing to be an impact-first product team means recognizing that our responsibility is ultimately to contribute towards a successful business.


questions of whether we are “product-led” or “sales-led” are always secondary to the much more important question: “What are we doing to contribute to the success of our business?”


Low-impact work creates more complicated products which, in turn, lead to more dependencies and conflicts to manage. Those dependencies and conflicts discourage teams from taking on work that touches on the product’s commercial core. Which, in turn, encourages more low-impact work.


Ironically, “treating” the obvious symptoms of low-impact teams by adding more layers and processes to cross-team coordination often makes the root cause even worse.


Impact-first teams fight to work on the most important things for the business. Low-impact teams avoid this work if it requires too much coordination or invites too much scrutiny.


The single most important characteristic of an impact-first team is that they actively seek out the work that they believe will most meaningfully contribute to the success of the business.


Impact-first teams accept scrutiny from the organization at large as a sign that the work they’re doing is consequential to the organization at large. They recognize that the probing questions they receive from important stakeholders might help them better understand the broader context of the work at hand. They are open to having challenging conversations to coordinate with other teams if that coordination delivers better results for the business. And, above all else, they recognize that their job is ultimately to deliver impactful work, even when it is not easy work.


Impact-first teams commit to big goals that are largely outside of their control. Low-impact teams commit to small goals that are fully within their control.

Impact-first teams keep their goals front and center throughout the planning and development process. Low-impact teams only think about their goals during intermittent goal-setting exercises or “seasons.”


Impact-first teams see product development processes as a means to an end. Low-impact teams care more about doing things the “right way” than about doing the right things.


Impact-first teams understand that tools and ways of working are simply a means to an end. These teams recognize that the primary takeaway from popular ways of working like “the Spotify model” is to purpose-build your own ways of working that help you achieve your own goals in your own specific context, not to “just do what famous company X does.” They are constantly adjusting their ways of working to help them deliver results for their specific business.


Impact-first teams recognize that their own operation comes at a cost to the business. Low-impact teams see any value they bring to the business as purely additive.

The answer to that question is not terribly fun to acknowledge out loud, but it bears stating plainly: the overall success of a product is outside of your control.


a product team already does bear the consequences of the success of their product and business overall. In other words, product teams are already accountable for things outside of their control, whether or not they accept it.


“If you were in charge of the company, would you fully fund this team?”


If your team is costing the business hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, what are you doing to deliver a return on that investment?


That singular focus didn’t just speed up decision-making, it helped us truly have an impact as we considered aspects that are overlooked.


Prioritizing in the open against a single, transparent, impact-level goal allowed us to make the best decisions we could at the speed we needed. It also helped increase inclusivity, and helped us make decisions that would have been overlooked if we didn’t focus on the real aim of the app. It’s so easy to get distracted by multiple competing goals, which end up diluting the impact you have.


Building a product is never simple work, but it’s important to keep in mind, above all else, why you’re seeking to build that product in the first place.


Here we run up against one of the most challenging disconnects between product development theory and reality: a product that is desirable, feasible, and generally viable might fail completely if it does not contribute meaningfully to the specific needs of the specific business building it.


a product team cannot really deliver “viable” work if they don’t understand what viability means to their particular business.


What are the measurable conditions that must be met for our business to be successful at a specific point in the future?


We must have at least [number] of [business metric] by [date] so that [business-critical milestone].


The business model—how we make money—is intrinsically customer-centric. Focusing on the business model forces us to learn more about what our customers find valuable. Otherwise, we can’t sell them anything.”


starting with business-level impact in mind doesn’t mean you are putting your customers last. It means that you are putting the commercial relationship between your business and your customers front and center, and letting that relationship guide how you learn about and build solutions for your customers.

Instead, product teams should be cognizant of the impact, outcomes, and output they are seeking to drive—and should always be willing to adjust the latter two in service of the first.


But giving a product team an outcome-level goal (customer retention) without a corresponding impact-level goal (recurring revenue) potentially limits that team’s ability to pursue any and all available levers to ensure the business ultimately succeeds.

when business-level impact is understood across the organization, it is easier to discuss ethical trade-offs, not harder.


Even a basic understanding of a company’s funding strategy, business model, and revenue targets can be critical for aligning a product team’s success with that of the business overall.


If you don’t really understand how the company makes money, you’ve got a problem. And when you do understand how the company makes money, you’re better positioned to understand and address customer needs holistically in a way that still adds up to a thriving and sustainable business.


impact-first teams can find a team-level goal that plays on their strengths, informs their decisions, and ties in directly to company-level ambitions.


What measurable contributions will this team make to be considered a successful part of the business at a specific point in the future?


any team at any level within an organization should be able to understand and articulate how (and how much) its work contributes to the overall success of the business.


Teams that have a point of view on their contribution to the business at large often wind up in the strongest position to understand and navigate the expectations of the business at large.


the most effective product teams are those that have team-level goals that are both high-impact and high-specificity.


It was high-impact, in that it could be tied directly to the company’s most critical revenue goals. And it was high-specificity, in that it represented an ambition to achieve a particular amount of impact by a particular moment in time.


Figure 3-2: Cascading goals vs. orbiting goals, adapted from Christina Wodtke’s Radical Focus


If we imagine our team goals orbiting around our high-level company goals rather than fitting into a multilevel cascade, we are less likely to waste time and effort creating a false sense of certainty and control.


Quantitatively, team goals should be no more than one mathematical operation away from company goals. To return to the example at the beginning of this chapter, the team’s goal of 10,000 multiproduct users is one operation (multiplying by the increased lifetime value of a multiproduct user) from being expressed in terms of the company’s revenue goals.


Qualitatively, team goals should be no more than one “why” away from company goals. Again, the team goal at the beginning of this chapter is one compelling, accessible “why” statement away from company goals: “Why are we seeking to convert 10,000 single-product users to multiproduct users? Because multiproduct users have a higher CLTV that contributes to the company’s revenue goals.”


“By the end of the quarter, do we want to onboard 10 users, 100 users, or 1,000 users?” Silence. Just as I was preparing to ask each team member to write their answer down on a secret ballot (a handy facilitation trick for kickstarting treacherous quantitative conversations!) one of the engineers on the team volunteered: “You know, I think we could do 1,000. And if we knew that was our goal, we’d be able to say ‘no’ to a lot of things that don’t really get us there.”


Having a specific number to work towards unblocked all the decisions that came after; which users to focus on, which features and functionalities they would need, and when those features would be “good enough.”


In my experience, the teams best equipped to make impact-first decisions are those who are willing to commit to goals that are “good enough” to influence their day-to-day decisions, rather than engaging in relentless circular debates about the “right way” to set goals at a team and organizational level. After all, the true test of our goals doesn’t come until we use them to guide our day-to-day work.


A product team at a “freemium” B2C startup has as a “north star” goal of achieving a 2 percent increase in daily conversion rate from the product’s homepage to free sign-ups by the end of the quarter, as a contribution towards the company’s overall user growth goal.


Are our team goals no more than one understandable step away from company goals? Do our team goals contribute to company-level goals enough to justify the company’s investment in the team itself? Do our team goals involve customer and market dynamics and behaviors beyond our immediate control? Have we considered at least two alternate orders of magnitude in arriving at our team goals? Have we discussed our specific goals with the folks in leadership who will be holding us accountable for working towards those goals?


For supporting and operational teams to effectively set impact-level goals, these teams usually need to be in close conversation with the teams they are supporting.


Figure 4-1: Impact at every step through a generalized “middle”


For that reason, I advise the teams and organizations I work with to keep business impact front and center at every step of “the middle,” whatever those steps might be.


Richard Rumelt defines strategy as, “ . . . how you overcome the obstacles that stand between where you are and what you want to achieve.” I quite like this definition, as it speaks directly to impact (“what you want to achieve”) and also leaves room for businesses to address the unique challenges they may face based on their business model and position in the market.


The discomfort we feel when we hold ourselves accountable for specific goals outside of our immediate control can be the most powerful motivator for teams to actually do meaningful discovery work.


Who needs to do what for us to achieve our impact-level goals—and why would they do it?


What is the most impact we could reasonably expect from a given piece of work?


stop wasting its time considering work that had no chance of delivering meaningful results in the first place.


The farther from impact they get, the more likely they are to follow an intermediate goal or plan that might be outdated, off-base, or otherwise fail to deliver success for the business.


If you’re even 51 percent sure that a different approach is going to get us 1 percent closer to achieving our goal by the end of the year, I want you to advocate for it.”


“What specific shorter-term signals should we see if we are on track to achieving our impact-level goals?”


mapping out our intermediate goals and milestones meant that we couldn’t just sit back and hope for the best. We had to actually deliver things on a regular cadence if we wanted to make any real, measurable progress.1


In other words, the key to adaptability is not less planning, it is more regular, choreographed, and foreseen planning.


For that reason, I recommend establishing a regular cadence to evaluate progress and ask those big, challenging questions about whether the approach you’re taking is actually helping you deliver success for the business at large.


Truly impact-first product teams shift the conversation from “how can we isolate and track only our contribution?” to “how can we understand and celebrate the ways in which every team worked together to deliver success?”


“The people at your organization telling you to ‘just build something’ might know things that you and your team do not, and you should approach them with curiosity rather than dismissing them out of hand.”


Product work is intrinsically communicative and political work.


“If you were in charge of the company, would you fully fund this team?”


If an executive cornered you and asked you why your team’s work is important for the business, how would you answer? If this team and its work disappeared tomorrow, what impact would it have on the business? Is there another team whose work you would consider particularly impactful? Why? And how can you learn from them and their approach?


“What are the measurable conditions that must be met for our business to be successful at a specific point in the future?”


The company’s existential success hinges on achieving [profitability] by [the end of the year] because [it has promised its investors that it will do so].


The company’s existential success hinges on achieving [10,000 monthly active users] by [the end of the quarter] because [it is running low on cash and it will be very hard to raise the next round of investment without a sizable user base].


“What measurable contributions will this team make to to be considered a successful part of the business at a specific point in the future?”


What would this team need to accomplish for us to all feel confident about our contributions to the business by the end of the quarter or year? Are our team-level goals both high-impact (no more than one step away from company goals) and high-specificity (attached to specific targets and timelines)? Which stakeholders in the organization will be evaluating our team’s success, and what matters most to them? (e.g., Department heads, other product managers and teams.)
