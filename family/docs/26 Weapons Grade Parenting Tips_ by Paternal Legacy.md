1/ Give them a "heads up," 5 minutes until bedtime, 10 minutes before leaving the playground


3/ Don’t discipline like an angry madman. Stay calm and firm, model how you want THEM to resolve conflict


4/ Let them argue their case respectfully. Teaches negotiation and critical thinking


6/ Use natural consequences: forgot homework? Let them explain it to the teacher. Forgot their lunch? They'll figure it out


7/ Be consistent and follow through. "We are leaving the playground if you don't stop..."


8/ Make "How can I help?" part of YOUR vocabulary. It builds reliability


9/ Share your unseen efforts: hustling for work, hitting the gym. Actions speak louder than words but when they can’t see it, TELL THEM


11/ Create family traditions like weekly movie nights, Sunday pancakes, whatever works


17/ Introduce chess or checkers. Start early


19/ Always greet your wife with love. That moment sets the tone for the family


22/ Teach the value of money early: "wants vs. needs," compounding, saving, etc


24/ Teach them to cook. Start small: eggs, pancakes, cookies. Embrace the mess


25/ No screens at meals ever
